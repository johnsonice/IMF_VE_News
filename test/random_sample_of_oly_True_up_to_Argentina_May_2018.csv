South America, unlike the US or Europe, seems to have rejected populism.  >Argentina > was the first to do so, in late 2015, when Mauricio Macri unexpectedly won the presidency.  >\n >Politically centrist, economically liberal and socially conscious, the former businessman is emblematic of a new pragmatism in the region. This has been a refreshing change from the ideology, corruption and mismanagement that characterised many of the “pink tide” populists who came before.  >\n >Lately, though, Argentina has hit a bumpy patch, suffering  >protests and strikes >. How Mr Macri now manages the turbulence is important for Argentina, a G20 member; more crucially is that his policies and actions may represent a blueprint that could be adapted by reformers elsewhere. >\n >In many ways, it is remarkable how popular Mr Macri remains. He inherited an economy riddled with wasteful subsidies, cut off from international credit, bereft of investment, and suffering from currency controls and dwindling reserves. His economic team moved swiftly: it settled with foreign bondholders to restore access to global credit; dismantled currency controls; and jacked up interest rates to tackle an increase in inflation. Despite a recession, his government’s popularity rating remains around 50 per cent. >\n >That is quite a feat for a country one year into an adjustment programme. It is all the more remarkable given a series of political gaffes by Mr Macri, such as the unnecessary cancellation of a public holiday. Indeed, his relatively high ratings are at least partly due to the unpopularity of his predecessor, Cristina Fernández. She remains the most visible leader of the opposition Peronists, despite multiple corruption investigations into her affairs and her former ministers. >\n >These scandals have profited Mr Macri politically. They have enabled him to cast Argentina’s future as a binary choice: a return to the past with the Peronists, or a new future with his party Cambiemos (Let’s change). Most Argentines seem to prefer  >Mr Macri’s vision >. On April 1, tens of thousands took to the streets, chanting: “We don’t want to go back.” By contrast, a Peronist-inspired general strike the following week had little support. Crucial midterm elections in October will provide a more decisive referendum. >\n >Before then, Mr Macri needs a rise in Argentina’s economic feelgood factor. Although the recession has ended, most are yet to feel any benefit. High but falling inflation has cut into real wages, and the popular mood is tetchy. To soothe tempers, Mr Macri has lately slowed cuts in social spending and delayed the end of domestic subsidies. This buys him support but at a cost. The fiscal deficit, at 7 per cent of economic output, is untamed and debt levels are rising. Both have undone too many reform programmes in the past. >\n >Every 12 years or so, Argentina, a land of perpetually thwarted promise, receives a second chance; Mr Macri is the latest. His government is the country’s best hope in a generation. Despite some failings, its achievements have been considerable. Its reform programme deserves international support and investment. That includes from the US and from Donald Trump.  >\n >Still, when Mr Macri visits President Trump in Washington on Thursday, both leaders need to avoid any echo of the conflict of interest scandal that erupted in November when then president-elect Trump reportedly asked Mr Macri, a former business associate, to approve construction of a $100m tower in Buenos Aires. At home, as in Washington, Mr Macri must tread a delicate political path. >\n >","title":"Mauricio Macri’s reforms provide the best hope for Argentina","standfirst":"The economics are working but the

While Greece has enough money to fund itself until July, ministers fear that 2017’s complicated electoral map means the real deadline for an agreement is much sooner. The next meeting of Euro area finance ministers on February 20 is the last before the Dutch general election. >\n >Another concern is that prolonged uncertainty could hit investor confidence in Greece, turning the IMF’s predictions into a self-fulfilling prophecy. According to EU officials, behind the scenes work is continuing apace to try and deliver some kind of breakthrough at the meeting, with everyone aware of the stakes. >\n >As one senior European official puts it, “February is not formally, but [is] realistically, the time when one needs to reach political agreement.” The hope is that this week can be the storm before (eventually) the calm, rather than, well, something far worse. >\n > >Email >  >jim.brunsden@ft.com >  >Twitter > @jimbrunsden >\n >Elsewhere in Europe >\n > >Where are all the French women? > Emmanuel Macron  >issued a plea > for more women to join his movement as potential MPs. >\n > > >When the first applications came in, just 15 per cent were from women.

All feedback is welcome, particularly of the constructive variety, as we try to get this right. (Email to  >authersnote@ft.com >). >\n > > >Sign up to receive Authers’ Note daily by email  >here >\n >\n >\n >\n >I have a pile of ID badges and lanyards to recycle. After a busy few weeks on the conference circuit, here are a few things that caught my attention. And the first and most important did not so much catch my attention as terrify me. >\n >Cyber attacks are rising ever further up the list of reasons for fear. At this point, they arguably head it. At the annual Sibos conference, a huge jamboree for everyone involved in the mechanics of making finance work, cyber defence was crowding out almost all other concerns. The last time I went to Sibos, three years ago, everyone was talking about blockchain technology and bitcoin. Cyber defence was almost nowhere. Bitcoin's price continues to rise, but defence against cyber crime now floods out everything. Despite the interest (and this is the only point I can find from all of this), it seems hard to identify a way to make money from this. There has been a cyber security ETF (with the predictable ticker symbol HACK) since late in 2014, and it has been lagging the S&amp;P since then. So there is money to be made by finding a company that can successfully combat cyber crime: >\n >A poll of Sibos participants asked them what kept them awake at night the most. Nobody mentioned China, and only one per cent mentioned the euro (so this might be the time to short China and the eurozone). US politics perhaps predictably came first on 43 per cent; cyber crime was next at 33 per cent.  >\n >The numerous cyber crime events were packed out. Not surprisingly: according to Microsoft, some 70 per cent of businesses expect to be attacked this year. Speaker after speaker urged companies to practise \"cyber hygiene\" (which is a thing now, apparently). And the concern is that the securities industry, rather than the payments system, could become a prime target. Bond issuance and trading is being digitalised, and this creates more opportunities for fraud, such as selling fake bonds.  >\n >There are many ways in which a focused cyber attack could become a systemic incident. If the repo market were to crash (rather as it did in 2008), then the repercussions could be systemic. Or any successful attempt to pull money directly out of accounts could wound trust in the banking system and send everyone to the ATM.  >\n >The risk of cyber attacks also makes companies harder to manage, as more than half of cyber fraud is committed from inside companies. Cyber attackers look for the weakest link, which is likely to be a person, rather than a string of code. And hackers can also benefit from finding the weakest link in terms of common sense, rather than moral fibre. One Microsoft adage is that in every organisation, there is always at least one employee who clicks on every link — and thus opens the entire company to malware, ransomware or whatever. >\n >Dealing with this issue requires great recruitment, and great management if a company is not to lose its ability to talk to itself. Regulators now want to see more data trails, increasing risks, while the increasing use of the \"internet of things\" creates more threats.  >\n >A secure solution will also require some serious game theory. Information technology is generally thought of as a source of competitive advantage, and companies certainly do not want to reveal confidential data to competitors. But the risks of systemic damage are so great that companies will have to collaborate on this.  >\n >Small wonder that Sibos drafted in an admiral from the US Navy to discuss the threats. Fighting cyber crime will require almost military discipline and strategy. And there are no precedents to guide it. >\n\n >Frankfurt-bound >\n >Another survey at Sibos might raise alarm in London. Delegates were asked to name which city would supplant London as a financial centre. \"None\" was an option. And yet the clear winner, named by 45 per cent, was Frankfurt. >\n >Germany's financial capital still has an image problem. Once the results were on the screen, several people started joking loudly that it must be because of the great Frankfurt nightlife. But that combination should be even more concerning. Nobody denies that London is a great and exciting city (at least for those who can afford it): but many still expect dowdy Frankfurt to overtake it.  >\n >And that was before Goldman Sachs' Lloyd Blankfein demonstrated his mastery of the telling tweet: >\n\n\n >NORA and the Python >\n >I am usually wary of acronyms, but Nora is tugging at my heartstrings. It stands for Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness, a name originally coined for a data-mining technology for finding relationships between people. Developed by Systems Research and Development (now part of IBM) for the Las Vegas gaming industry, it helped casinos detect relationships between cheats, and was subsequently used to probe deep into organised crime.  >Back in 2002, its backers were saying: > \"It will tell you that the Drug Enforcement Agency's agent's college roommate's ex-wife's current husband is the drug lord.\"  >\n >Now, Hylton Socher, chief technology officer of Fortress Investment Group, suggests that the alpha in public data is in finding relationships. Finding patterns in the data that are not obvious is critical. Getting hold of data these days is easy; all the advantage that one investor can gain over another is in minding it to form a \"data mosaic\" and find more non-obvious relationships. \"How do you increase your Nora?\" >\n >He was speaking on a panel I chaired at MSCI's risk management conference in the US, and it is obvious that everyone else — not just the technologists — agreed with him. Beating the market is ever harder, you can only expect to do it regularly with an advantage in information. And so active investment management has become a job of scraping information from every source, pouring it all down a funnel, and hoping your Nora is high enough to spot something nobody else has seen. That way you can make money.  >\n >If you really care about Nora, you can put a python down the funnel. Python is one of the most popular data-mining tools, prompting Colin Moore, CIO of Columbia Threadneedle, to complain that \"I thought a python was a snake\". Pythons have, however, helped to turn information that was formerly too dense into something that can make money. >\n >Note that this technology is not about finding patterns in the market — that mine may finally have been mined to exhaustion, with some claiming to have found as many as 6m separate factors. It is also not about collecting data in the first place, although many fund groups are investing in this. This is just about a technological arms race to raise Nora and find some previously invisible moneymaking edge. >\n >A warning to private investors out there: your own personal Nora is nowhere near as high as that of a large hedge fund's computer. And you cannot afford to try to match their computer.  >\n\n >Argentine Century bonds make sense >\n >Everyone is looking for signs that we have reached the final stages of a bubble, and Argentina's success in launching a 100-year bond looks as good a sign as any. Given the country's multiple defaults of the 20th century, and its dreadful start to the 21st, it is hard to see why anyone would want to lend it money for 100 years. >\n >But there is a rational defence. Speaking at the CFA Society of New York's annual dinner, Jeffrey Rosenberg >* > of BlackRock said: \"If you're laughing at that, don't laugh.\"  >\n >Rather than think of the bond's long-term credit risk before repaying the principal, he told us all to think of its duration. It pays $8m per year, to someone who has invested $100m. The principal may not be paid back for 100 years, but it will have paid $240m in interest in the next 30 years. Therefore, he pointed out, its duration was not so much greater than that of a 10-year Treasury bond.  >\n >Therefore, he said, it can make sense to buy even with the obviously high credit risk. BlackRock put in a big order and is happy with the results. If it defaults after 99 years it will already have paid plenty of interest — and it will not be the problem of anyone around now.  >\n\n >Minsky Moment (ming si ji-shi ke) >\n >I think this week's Long View, on the People's Bank of China talking about a Minsky Moment, is more important than most. I also learned what \"Minsky Moment\" is in Chinese, from kind commenter David Wilder.  >\n >Let us hope we never need to use it, but here it is:  >\n >Have a good weekend. >\n >* In the note headed “Argentine Century bonds make sense”, I attributed to Jeffrey Rosenberg of BlackRock comments about the reasons for buying Argentine bonds that were in fact made by Bruce Richards, who is the chairman and CEO of Marathon Asset Management, a distressed debt investor. It was my mistake while taking the notes. >\n >I apologise to both men for the error.  >\n\n >","title":"Authers’ Note: Notes from the Conference Circuit","standfirst":"FT’s new daily newsletter on

In equities, a business the bank is trying to expand, revenues were up 15 per cent. >\n >Overall,  >Citi > generated $3.57bn in net income, a rise of 7 per cent from a year earlier. >\n >The figures wrap up a strong batch of trading figures from the biggest US banks, reinforcing a trend set by JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley in recent days as well as  >Goldman Sachs > on Wednesday. >\n >The upsurge follows a long squeeze on bond trading caused by tightened regulation and intermittent client activity, which has weighed on profitability and prompted widespread job cuts on Wall Street. >\n >The strong finish to 2016 is a boost for Michael Corbat, chief executive, who has largely protected the bank’s trading desks while shrinking other big chunks of the group. >\n >Some analysts have questioned whether the recovery is sustainable, but Mr Corbat said the strong finish to 2016 brought “momentum into this year”. >\n >“Our core businesses are beginning to produce the returns our investors expect and deserve,” he added. >\n >Shares in Citi, a former financial supermarket that has slimmed down since the crisis but still has $1.8tn in assets, trade at a 20 per cent discount to the bank’s book value — a sign of investor caution. >\n >The share price has risen 17 per cent since the election but underperformed other US bank stocks, partly because Citi is more global and may benefit less from rising interest rates in the US.  >\n >Some investors are also concerned about Mr Trump’s protectionist rhetoric, and the possible impact on Citi’s chunky  >business in Mexico >. >\n >Revenues across the bank fell 8 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year ago to $17bn, in part because Citi has continued to dispose of businesses around the world as part of efforts to recover from the financial crisis. In recent months the bank has struck deals to sell assets in Canada, Argentina and Brazil. >\n >Lower expenses helped the bank beat analysts’ forecasts for diluted earnings per share — it reported $1.14, above the $1.12 expected. >\n >Despite the strong fourth quarter, net income for 2016 as a whole dropped 14 per cent to $14.9bn, reflecting last year’s difficult start for trading as well as pressures on the banking business caused by low interest rates and toughened regulation. >\n >Net interest margins, a measure of lending profitability, came in at 2.79 per cent in the fourth quarter, down from 2.86 per cent the previous quarter, as the Fed’s rate rise came too late to boost earnings. >\n >The bank has done more lending and acquired a branded credit card portfolio from American Express last summer. Revenues from the consumer banking operation rose 2 per cent to $8bn — in constant currencies, the increase was 5 per cent. >\n >However, quarterly net income at the consumer division fell 7 per cent from a year ago to $1.3bn. The higher revenues were offset by bigger provisions for loan losses, which Citi said were down mostly to the acquisition of the credit cards, which use the brand of low-cost retailer Costco. >\n >Citi shares, which had lost 2.1 per cent in a broad market sell-off on Tuesday, ticked up 0.2 per cent in pre-market trading on Wednesday. >\n >","title":"Citigroup delivers first profit rise in four

In fact, nearly every evening for dinner I eat a steak and a sharp knife — I mean a deadly sharp knife — greatly enhances my pleasure. >\n >We have two homes, one in Cape Town and one in London, and in each home I have a drawer filled with about 30 steak knives. Some of them are real beauties, masterpieces. One of my favourites is by a knife maker in France who uses mammoth ivory for the handles. >\n >When I’m going away, I go to the kitchen and look at the knives in the drawer and decide which one appeals to me in that moment. (The steak knife goes in the hold — I don’t try to take them on board.) >\n >We travel all over the place. Very recently we went to Japan because my wife wanted to ski there. I don’t ski any more — if you’re over 60 and still skiing you should have your head read — but I watched her [his wife is younger]. Thankfully I’ve escaped without broken bones. We go every year to Switzerland, and we also go to India to see tigers and travel regularly in central Africa because I love the wildlife. We also used to go to Argentina a lot to fish for trout. >\n >Some of my earliest travels were to Egypt, where I’ve set six novels, based on the ancient Egyptians. Just before I was born, they found Tutankhamun’s tomb. My mother was captivated by it and later on, as the tomb was excavated and the treasures brought to life, she passed that enthusiasm on to me. When the time came for me to travel out of southern Africa to London to promote my first novel,  >When the Lion Feeds > (1964), I went via Cairo and travelled up and down the Nile. I’ve been enchanted with Egypt ever since and for the next 20 to 30 years I went back regularly, hiring camels and going to all the known sites. >\n >In London I eat steak at Annabel’s, in Cape Town there are probably a dozen places. When I go out to a restaurant for a steak I’ll take my own knife. I don’t tend to get funny looks, but sometimes the waiter will ask to have a look at it and occasionally suggest I’m not really allowed to carry it. To which I’ll say: “You’re not going to tell anyone, are you?” >\n > >Wilbur Smith was born in 1933 in what is now Zambia, and published his first novel in 1964. He has gone on to write 38 novels, selling more than 100m books in 20 languages. His latest is ‘Pharaoh’ (HarperFiction).

Opec increased its world demand forecasts for 2018.

Part of this is due to constraints on new US production. Still, non-Opec supply was revised higher slightly, by 10,000 b/d as higher predictions for output from the US, Argentina, Colombia and China were largely offset by downward revisions to Canada, Mexico, Norway, UK, and Brazil.

The EU side is watching. They need a British prime minister to achieve two things by March 2019. The first is to give a final political push to complete the first phase of separation talks, which to Brussels basically means accepting a bigger exit bill and a standstill transition with no frills. >\n >The second is to master politics in Westminster so that the withdrawal deal can be seen through. That probably means resolving the debate over Brexit Britain’s destination in a coherent, realistic manner — a big ask, even for a prime minister with rock-solid authority. >\n >Sam Coates today explores some of the cabinet faultlines  >in The Times >. Biggest of all: whether the UK should mirror EU rules and pay to access the single market. Some questions are so fundamental they will help decide who succeeds May, whether she goes tomorrow or years from now. >\n >For this reason the EU side faces a dilemma. It is not just whether to compromise in the coming months, but whether it is worth compromising with May given the risk she may be ousted. >\n >As a British diplomat in Brussels told Timothy: “The Europeans respect the PM and like it when she speaks, but every time a minister freelances, it invites them to sit back, do nothing and blame Britain for the lack of progress.” >\n > >Email >:  > >alex.barker@ft.com >\n >\n >\n >Twitter >:  >@alexebarker >\n >\n\n >What Europe made of May >\n\n > >Le Monde  >\n >Theresa May fragile after the fiasco of her conference speech >\n >\n > >Liberation  >\n >The speech that turned into torture >\n >\n > >Les Echos  >\n >May tries to regain her hand but loses her voice >\n >\n > >De Standaard  >\n >Theresa May hardly survives her speech >\n >\n > >Handelsblatt  >\n >May coughs and the Conservatives splutter >\n >\n > >FAZ  >\n >A speech full of bad luck and breakdowns >\n >\n > >De Volkskrant >  >'The British Dream' speech ends in nightmare >  >\n >Chart du jour: the Franco-German engine  >\n\n\n >The French and German economies are in their rudest health since 2011, according to the latest influential business survey of the countries’ private sectors from Markit.  >\n >What we’re reading in Europe >\n\n > >A compromised king  >Catalonia’s president reacted with predictable fury to the Spanish king’s rare intervention in the region’s troubles, accusing the monarch of supporting Madrid’s  >“catastrophic” policies. >  >\n >The constitutional crisis is spilling into financial markets amid talk that some Catalan companies are beginning to  >draw up contingency plans > to move their headquarters to Madrid in the event of independence.

The centre seems to lose space,” he said. “That will make Piñera’s job much more difficult.” >\n >Carolina Goic, representing the Christian Democrats, who made a historic break from Ms Bachelet’s coalition this year, was trailing in fifth place with less than 6 per cent. If Mr Piñera wins, the Christian Democrats are expected to play a central role in establishing the balance of power in a fragmented congress, since he would almost certainly lack a majority in both houses of congress.  >\n >At the centre of Mr Piñera’s campaign programme was a commitment to revitalise Chile’s stagnant economy, returning to the average growth rate of about 5 per cent that he enjoyed during his first term, buoyed by high  >commodity prices >. Annual growth has averaged less than 2 per cent since then.  >\n >Moneda Asset Management predicts that Chile’s growth will rebound to around 3.5 per cent next year, as copper prices recover and business confidence improves. Both took a big hit during the presidency of Ms Bachelet, whose reform programme was stridently rejected by investors.  >\n >Mr Piñera also benefited from a low turnout, which has fallen consistently since the return of democracy in 1990. Patricio Aylwin was elected president by almost 47 per cent of total voters in 1990, but Ms Bachelet was re-elected in 2013 by less than 26 per cent of the eligible voting population. >\n >If Mr Piñera’s win is confirmed and he joins Argentina’s Mauricio Macri as a successful businessman-turned-president, it will be the second time that he has succeeded Ms Bachelet. He followed her first term, which ran from 2005 to 2010, defeating her party that was seen then, much as it is now, as stagnant and riven by infighting.  >\n >","title":"Piñera wins first round in

Helped by generous subsidies from Beijing, Chinese  >industrial fishing fleets > are travelling further and further from their depleted home waters to find fish and squid, leading to growing tension with even friendly countries such as Argentina. >\n >The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation estimated last summer that 90 per cent of the commercial fish stocks it tracks have been  >overfished > or fully fished, including the world’s 10 most commercially productive species. >\n >“We are fishing deeper and further into the ocean,” says marine biologist Edgardo Fuentes of Universidad Austral de Chile. “As one species disappears, we are overfishing the next.” >\n >Chilean  >loco >, overharvested for export in the 1980s, almost disappeared. By the late 1990s, the country’s fishermen were catching eight times more than the recommended level of mackerel. Worldwide mackerel stocks went into free fall from 2006. Stocks of other species have also declined rapidly.  >\n >For the older fishermen in Valparaíso, hake was their livelihood. The white fish was a mainstay of Chile’s exports, until overfishing caused stocks of the species to collapse early this century. “These days there are very few hake. Not all the boats are working,” laments Juan Gómez, who at 64 is mostly retired from fishing but remains the unofficial poet of the wharfs. “I am in love with the sea, I am a fisherman’s son. It’s hard to work for other things.” >\n >Squid is taking the place of declining stocks. In Valparaíso, artisanal fishermen operating out of Caleta Portales rely on squid for about half of their income. And the carts now sell enchiladas stuffed with squid, which locals call  >loco de los pobres >, or “poor man’s loco”.  >\n >Even Corpesca, the nation’s largest fishing conglomerate, has moved into the game. Chilean fishermen were outraged in 2012 when the revised fisheries law gave Corpesca a permanent quota for 20 per cent of the squid catch.  >\n >“Other species have collapsed so these ships and technology are being applied to squid,” Mr Fuentes says. “Squid is becoming a new option.” >\n >*** >\n >The emergence of squid as a commercially important species traces the decline of more popular fish. Fishermen like Mr Gómez blame squid for eating the hake. Not so, says Ian Scott, an independent fisheries consultant: “The counter-argument is that overfishing of many stocks left a ‘gap’ in the ecosystem that was filled by jumbo squid.” >\n >Fishing statistics can be difficult to pin down. Where it is regulated, fishermen tend to under-report catches to bypass quotas. On the open ocean, no one counts. And corporations in China, which accounts for about 18 per cent of the world’s fish caught in the wild, sometimes over-report their catch to meet Beijing’s output growth targets and compete for subsidies.  >\n >Squid now accounts for more than half of the Chinese fleet’s catch outside its home waters. What the Chinese boats catch, the world eats. Half of the fish caught by Chinese fishermen in international waters is re-exported, to Europe, north Asia and America.  >\n >The FAO estimates that squid made up 6 per cent of world fish trade in 2013, while Chinese estimates imply that is closer to 9 per cent. The two most commonly caught species of squid together ranked 11th among top types of fish caught from 2003-2012; by 2014 squid had moved up to the seventh most caught species.  >\n >Scientists know relatively little about squid. Sonar bounces off them differently to schools of fish, making it harder to map their population. Numbers fluctuate greatly from year to year, possibly due to the  >El Niño weather cycle >. Warming oceans may have expanded the geographic area where squid are found. They eat anything, even each other. >\n >Could stocks of squid collapse too? Some argue that squid are uniquely protected from the cycle of overfishing because of their short lifespans.  >\n >“Squid die anyway within a year and a half, so the resource is relatively stable,” says Hu Shibao, president of CNFC Overseas Fisheries Co, a unit of China’s largest state-owned fishing conglomerate. “We can anticipate how the market will be, and calculate the catch.” >\n >But squid are not immune to overfishing. Depleted resources in waters east of Siberia have pushed the Chinese fleet as far as Patagonia. Longer voyages have driven an expansion in capacity. “Volumes are big in South America. We need big volumes to make it worth it because the costs are high,” Mr Hu says. >\n >Stocks of Argentine shortfin squid have begun fluctuating sharply, leading the local fishermen to complain that Chinese boats sitting just outside their waters monopolise the catch.  >\n >Meanwhile part of the Chinese fleet has shifted to Peru and Chile to seek jumbo flying squid, an important Peruvian export. It does not taste as good but Chinese processors have found a way to mask the difference. Last March, the  >Argentine Coast Guard > fired on and sank a Chinese fishing boat in its territorial waters.  >\n >*** >\n >Fishing friction is not limited to squid. In the South China Sea, the Philippines and Indonesia regularly intercept Chinese boats. And Japan and China are at odds over the  >disputed Senkaku Islands >, known in Chinese as the Diaoyu, or “fishing”, islands.  >\n >The dynamics of overfishing and squid are best understood half a world away from Valparaíso in Zhoushan, the archipelago in eastern China that is home to 70 per cent of China’s squid fishing fleet. The islands stretch into what was once one of the world’s richest fishing zones, where the muddy waters of Hangzhou Bay meet the East China Sea just south of Shanghai. >\n >“The resource collapse was particularly striking here,” says Chen Wei, vice-director of the Zhoushan Commodity Exchange Centre. In a sign of the times his echoingly empty new building was established to help cash-strapped warehouses pay the boats laden with fish, and keep Zhoushan’s processing factories in business.  >\n >“In recent years because the fish have retreated we became the centre for overseas fishing. Because it was a big fishing area in the past processing is very developed, so that’s how Zhoushan became the main place for squid processing.”  >\n >Zhoushan’s squid crown is challenged by the northern port of Qingdao, China’s largest fish processing centre. Factories around Qingdao borrowed heavily and expanded to process white fish fillets for export to Europe, only to find their margins threatened by overcapacity. They too are switching to squid as the supply of white fish falters.  >\n >“They have bigger plants but we have the integrated chain: boats, processing and exports,” Mr Chen says.  >\n >Beijing is worried that the collapse of local fisheries will trigger job losses at fish processing plants in coastal communities like Zhoushan. But its response has added to the pressure on global resources. Strict seasonal fishing bans along the Chinese coast (this year’s is the broadest ever) are offset with subsidies — for diesel, shipbuilding and expanded seafood processing industrial zones — that push the Chinese fleet into international waters.  >\n >The subsidies have enabled an “unhinged” growth in China’s deep- >water fishing capacity, Greenpeace said in a  >2016 report >. It concludes that the Chinese industry has expanded “far beyond its means”.  >\n >Like the fishermen of Valparaíso, Zhoushan villagers did not particularly care about squid before the 1970s. Then China ended its experiment with communal fishing co-operatives and families returned to the sea to make a living in the new market economy. Stocks of yellow croaker, crab and cuttlefish in the East China Sea declined swiftly.  >\n >As stocks in nearby waters dwindled, Zhoushan’s fishing families banded together to invest in bigger boats. They chased migrating croaker north to the cold waters east of Vladivostok, where they found squid. Clashes with Korean and Japanese ships prompted one of China’s first maritime agreements, demarcating overlapping economic zones in the 1990s following the adoption of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.  >\n >By that time, the Japanese flying squid favoured in north Asia cooking was under strain. Zhoushan bosses invested in even bigger ships, capable of longer voyages. They paid for their sons to stay in school and contracted farmers from poor inland regions to man the boats. >\n >As voyages became more expensive boat owners pooled their resources to form companies like Ningtai Ocean, China’s largest private fishing company with 60 boats. Others funded enormous transport ships, so the fishing fleet can stay out for two years.  >\n >Chinese boats can range so far because of a tenfold increase in diesel subsidies between 2006 and 2011, after which Beijing stopped releasing statistics, according to the Greenpeace report.  >\n >“If it weren’t for the diesel subsidy under these conditions most fishermen would fold,” says Wang Zhongxiao, head of Ningtai Ocean. “Before, conditions were better and we were profitable without the subsidies. Now, we need them.” Zhoushan today has been overtaken by the strange logic of Chinese overcapacity: if you have too much of something, build more.  >\n >Exhibit A is Zhoushan’s new Rmb5.6bn ($823m) “national port”, built to accommodate its much larger ocean-going vessels. Nearby processing factories are being upgraded and their facilities expanded. The new port is tasked with offloading 1m tonnes of seafood a year by 2020, more than double the region’s current haul.  >\n >Competition from other large new ports planned along the Chinese coast means Zhoushan’s new port is still far from reaching its goal, laments Lin Zhigang, deputy head at the port construction headquarters. His solution? Bring in more fish and squid from faraway seas. “Everyone has to eat, and now eats more and more. So the resources have to come.” >\n > >Additional reporting by Luna Lin >\n >\n\n >Letter in response to this article: >\n > > >We must curb over-fishing before it is too late / From Dr John Law,

It said the full-year earnings before interest and tax of the agribusiness operations is expected to come in between $800m to $1bn, thanks to soyabean crush margins.  >\n >It said the increase in crush margins had not immediately translated into higher profits because of $120m of losses on derivative contracts used to lock in margins. However, the impact would reverse later in the year as the underlying deals were completed. >\n >Argentina’s worst drought in five decades hit output of soyabeans, which are crushed to make feed for livestock. Argentina is the world’s top exporter of soyabean meal, and prices for the commodity jumped, leading to higher processing margins in the Americas. >\n >ADM said on Tuesday its oilseeds business was likely to report more than $1bn in operating earnings this year because of the drought in Argentina and strong demand. >\n >“We would expect shares to outperform today given the markedly more upbeat outlook and underlying first quarter outperformance,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs. >\n >In contrast to the grains and oilseeds performance, Bunge’s sugar and bioenergy business remained weak, with losses before interest and tax up 40 per cent from a year earlier to $24m. The company reduced its full year outlook range with results expected to be seasonally weak until the second half of the year.  >\n >The company said it was “progressing towards the separation of our sugarcane milling business” and recently signed a share purchase agreement to sell its interest in our renewable oils joint venture, and was in the process of exiting the global sugar trading operation. >\n >Bunge reported net loss per share of 20 cents but stripping out $120m of mark-to-market hedging losses in its agribusiness division, the result was a loss 6 cents, better than many analysts had expected. >\n >“It is times like these when the value of our global footprint and capabilities are clearly demonstrated,” said Mr Schroder. “[It] Shows how relatively small crop production shortfalls can shift the delicate balance of supply and demand.” >\n >“2017 was an unusually challenging year; we expect the improved conditions will last well beyond this year as underlying demand is strong,” added. >\n >ADM made a takeover approach to Bunge, leading to deal talks that later fizzled out. Last year Glencore, the Swiss-based commodities trader, disclosed it had also approached Bunge about a possible deal but was rebuffed. >\n\n\n\n >","title":"Bunge forecasts strong earnings growth for 2018","byline":"Emiko Terazono and Neil Hume in London","firstPublishedDate":"2018-05-02T10:49:53.000Z","publishedDate":"2018-05-02T10:49:53.000Z","webUrl":"https://www.ft.com/content/ad3d1186-4df5-11e8-8a8e-22951a2d8493","requestUrl":"https://api.ft.com/enrichedcontent/ad3d1186-4df5-11e8-8a8e-22951a2d8493","brands":["http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"],"standout":{"editorsChoice":false,"exclusive":false,"scoop":false},"canBeSyndicated":"yes","apiUrl":"https://api.ft.com/enrichedcontent/ad3d1186-4df5-11e8-8a8e-22951a2d8493","prefLabel":"Bunge forecasts strong earnings growth for 2018","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article"],"annotations":[{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/99856c8e-6ef2-36e2-9b91-9017063bb640","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/people/99856c8e-6ef2-36e2-9b91-9017063bb640","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/person/Person"],"prefLabel":"Soren W.

Foreigners have bought heavily into Argentina’s peso-denominated debt, only to see the peso become one of the world’s worst performing currencies so far this year — losing 5 per cent against the US dollar — at a time when most  >currencies are strengthening against the greenback >. >\n >The country’s fast-won status as a market darling after Mr Macri took power just over two years ago has been tempered by confusion over a shift in the central bank’s interest rate policy last week.  >\n >The bank’s decision to cut its policy interest rate by 75 basis points to 27.25 per cent on January 23 took many in the financial community by surprise as most believe it will struggle to hit even its new, relaxed inflation target this year of 15 per cent.  >\n >“Analysts don’t understand what the central bank is doing at all,” says Marcos Buscaglia, an economist in Buenos Aires, who points out that forecasts of policy moves have consistently been wide of the mark. “That’s odd . . . there is a communications problem.” >\n >Alarm bells have been ringing for investors since the government relaxed the central bank’s inflation target in late December after market speculation of such a change triggered weakness in the peso that month.  >\n >After inflation reached 24.8 per cent in 2017, the move to tolerate a 15 per cent target — rather than a band of 8 per cent to 12 per cent — was seen as a response to widely-held concerns that high interest rates were stifling Argentina’s economic recovery. >\n >“What the market wants is a reaffirmation that inflation is [the central bank’s] priority,” says Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Nomura Securities International. >\n >The blow to the central bank’s credibility marks a dramatic change from investors’ exuberant attitude towards Argentina less than a year ago when the government  >sold a heavily oversubscribed 100-year bond >. Argentina’s stock market led global performance in 2017. >\n >Concerns that a new era of currency volatility in Argentina beckons have taken the shine off the “carry trade”, which involves borrowing at lower interest rates in one currency to invest at higher rates in another.  >\n >“The peso has clearly been too strong,” says Diego Ferro, co-chief investment officer at Greylock Capital Management. “Interest rates remain high so the carry trade still makes some sense, but [the peso] is going to be more volatile,” he added, referring to one of the hottest trades in emerging markets last year. >\n >While the Argentine carry trade may be in a mature phase — with foreigners holding almost $5bn of $61bn of the central bank paper that investors prefer for the trade — a mass exodus in the near term remains unlikely. >\n >“That would be a huge risk for the central bank . . . these things tend to be sudden, although it depends where the peso trades,” says Ms Morden, arguing that there is no motive for a sharp exit from the carry trade at the current exchange rate of almost 20 pesos to the dollar. >\n >Certainly, discouraging foreign investors from the carry trade would be premature, she says. Given Argentina’s under-developed local capital markets, the government continues to rely on foreign investors to finance a gaping fiscal deficit without resorting to printing money. >\n >Already this year, Argentina has  >issued $9bn in foreign debt >, although prices of its dollar-denominated bonds have fallen more than 3 per cent since January 1. Worse, Chubut province’s bond prices momentarily collapsed last week after a gaffe by its governor, who unintentionally said the province would “restructure” rather than refinance its debt. >\n >Even so, many remain confident that Argentina’s economic transformation under Mr Macri remains on track. Alberto Bernal, chief emerging markets strategist at XP Securities, even argued to clients that the peso would appreciate in real terms this year. >\n >“It is quite probable that if the peso continues to lose value [against the dollar] in a drastic manner, the central bank’s board will utilise some of the existing ammunition to counter [exchange rate] volatility,” he wrote in a note. >\n >For Daniel Melhem, managing partner at Knightsbridge Partners, an investment group in Buenos Aires, disagreements between officials over how economic policy should be managed is no cause for concern, especially after years of heavy-handed state intervention in the central bank. “When Sturzenegger leaves office, that’s when we have to be concerned — and not before.” >\n\n >","title":"Shift by Argentina’s central bank rings alarm bells","standfirst":"Doubts emerge over ability to hit inflation target after cut in interest rate","byline":"Benedict Mander in Buenos Aires","firstPublishedDate":"2018-01-31T15:10:08.000Z","publishedDate":"2018-01-31T15:10:08.000Z","webUrl":"https://www.ft.com/content/510d01fa-0660-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5","requestUrl":"https://api.ft.com/enrichedcontent/510d01fa-0660-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5","brands":["http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"],"standout":{"editorsChoice":false,"exclusive":false,"scoop":false},"canBeSyndicated":"yes","apiUrl":"https://api.ft.com/enrichedcontent/510d01fa-0660-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5","prefLabel":"Shift by Argentina’s central bank rings alarm bells","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article"],"annotations":[{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/92b03620-e041-378f-80af-0f65b76a4382","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/people/92b03620-e041-378f-80af-0f65b76a4382","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/person/Person"],"prefLabel":"Siobhan Morden","type":"PERSON","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/person/Person"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/about","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/9fcbd277-102b-4669-b9ee-502c81922ab3","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/things/9fcbd277-102b-4669-b9ee-502c81922ab3","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/Topic"],"prefLabel":"Emerging market investing","type":"TOPIC","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/Topic"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/majorMentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/344292f2-193b-3c94-8de3-259ef8fe00fd","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/people/344292f2-193b-3c94-8de3-259ef8fe00fd","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/person/Person"],"prefLabel":"Mauricio Macri","type":"PERSON","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/person/Person"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/50ffacaf-e0a0-355a-9469-0d1f8f552559","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/people/50ffacaf-e0a0-355a-9469-0d1f8f552559","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/person/Person"],"prefLabel":"Alberto J.

The president is trying to woo voters with a splurge on infrastructure spending, with a tripling in the value of tendered contracts in the first half of the year compared with 2016. Economists say the infrastructure spend is making the most important contribution to resuscitating Argentina’s  >economy > . Figures released this week showed seasonally adjusted growth reaching 2.8 per cent year-on-year in May, up from 1.7 per cent in April. \n >\n >But infrastructure has been a stubborn source of corruption in the past and Mr Macri is also trying to convince Argentines that it will be different this time.  >\n >“Many companies that left [because of past corruption] are now returning, as today they know there is complete transparency,” said Mr Dietrich, who is in charge of the $33bn infrastructure programme, about a quarter of which he hopes will be financed by the private sector.  >\n >Mr Macri is trying to make corruption a central issue in the elections. “The government wants the debate to be about the past versus the future, corruption versus no corruption,” said Julio Burdman, a political analyst. “Meanwhile the opposition wants the debate to be about the economy,” he adds, given its slow recovery.  >\n >According to Mr Burdman, Argentines are more concerned about corruption under former president and de facto leader of the Peronist opposition, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, than under Mr Macri. Many even suspect that Ms Fernández is running in these elections to secure immunity, as she is accused of using her family friend and business partner Lázaro Báez, who was imprisoned last year, to steal from public works projects. She denies all wrongdoing. >\n >Nevertheless, government critics scoff at attempts by Mr Macri, the son of one of Argentina’s richest men whose fortune was made partly from state contracts, to embody a new era in sound business ethics. “Corruption worried us with the previous government, and it continues to worry us now,” says Sebastián Pilo, co-director of the Civil Association for Equality and Justice, who observes that the system that permitted a lack of transparency before remains largely intact. “Until that changes, we will continue to have the right to doubt,” he adds.  >\n >Mr Pilo points to accusations of favouritism towards Mr Macri’s family company in negotiations over a debt to the state since its failed attempt to run the post office after it was privatised in the 1990s. Some aides of Mr Macri — who was also implicated in the Panama Papers affair last year — are even suspected of being involved in the Odebrecht scandal because of alleged ties with the company, which has admitted to paying bribes of $35m to win contracts in Argentina between 2007 and 2014.  >\n >The outcome of the elections hangs on whether or not Mr Macri can convince Argentines that his government really will bring the change he promises, and not just in infrastructure.  >\n >Poliarquia, a local pollster, predicts that the ruling coalition will be the force that grows most in congress, but it will be unable to gain a majority — even though no party will dominate the lower house.  >\n >Nevertheless, should Ms Fernández be elected senator — which Poliarquia deems “probable” — her presence in the upper house would deepen the fragmentation of the Peronist opposition and in effect remove its working majority, which is likely to shrink anyway. “It looks like Cristina is back,” said one seasoned Argentine executive, referring to Ms Fernandez. “She might make the debates in congress more lively but she will never win back the presidency.” >\n >","title":"Mauricio Macri

Some 61 per cent of those surveyed thought corruption was increasing, with just 15 per cent saying it was diminishing. >\n >Qatar saw the biggest fall in the 2016 index, with its score sliding 10 points from 71 to 61 on a scale of 0-100 where countries with the highest scores are seen as the cleanest, based on combining 13 indices created by the likes of the World Bank, Bertelsmann Foundation and Freedom House.  >\n >Kuwait and Bahrain both fell eight points, to 41 and 43 respectively, and Saudi Arabia six points to 46, as the first table shows.  >\n >The worsening of perceived corruption levels has come just as the Gulf states are increasingly turning to foreign investors for funding, with  >record international bond issuance > of $66bn in 2016.  >\n >“Gulf States have dropped on the index as ruling families continue to hold power politically and economically, public freedoms are oppressed, and an active independent civil society is absent,” said Ms Hattar. “The military involvement of these states in regional coalitions has raised the levels of secrecy and ambiguity of public expenditure and state budgets.” >\n >Qatar’s perceived corruption levels were further heightened by its implication in Fifa’s corruption scandals, particularly the decision to award the 2022 football World Cup to the country, as well as reports of human rights abuses of migrant workers. >\n >Shahin Shamsabadi, head of business intelligence for the Mena region at the Risk Advisory Group, a consultancy which launched its own  >Corruption Challenges Index > this week, said: “Corruption is something of an occupational hazard for foreign investors in Mena. Anti-corruption measures are typically reactive rather than proactive, and in some jurisdictions bribes are not only accepted but expected.” >\n >Despite the poor showing by Arab states in general, Finn Heinrich, research director at TI, said there was no single reason for their failings. >\n >“At the bottom [of the index] there are two types of countries. You have countries that are falling apart, where the state has retreated and where corruption is the way to get by for people. But there are others where the state has a lot of power but in a way that doesn’t provide any space for people to hold the government to account,” Mr Heinrich said. >\n >On a brighter note, the score of authoritarian Belarus has jumped by eight points, to an admittedly still low 40, as the second table shows. >\n >Mr Heinrich said the government of the former Soviet state has taken steps to prosecute a number of oligarchs suspected of corruption in the past year, but added “whether that is sustainable or is politically motivated we do not know,” at this stage.  >\n >More-troubled still Afghanistan has also seen a meaningful improvement, rising four points to 15. Mr Heinrich said Kabul had passed anti-corruption legislation, created a National High Council for Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption, a National Procurement Authority and a mandatory asset declaration policy for senior government officials, although he admits the jury is still out as to how effective these steps will prove. >\n >Brazil, up two points to 40, is perhaps another surprising riser in the Corruption Perceptions index, given the vast and sprawling  >Lava Jato > (car wash) corruption scandal that has exposed widespread wrongdoing by politicians, construction groups and Petrobras, the state-owned oil company. >\n >However Mr Heinrich said Brazil’s rating had fallen from 43 points in 2012 as a result of the scandal, and was now starting to recover due to the fact it is finally beginning to tackle endemic corruption. >\n >China, likewise, rose three points to 40 as a result of President Xi Jinping’s continuing anti-corruption drive. Last year alone, 415,000 Communist party members were disciplined and 11,000 expelled from the party and handed over to China’s courts for prosecution, according to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. >\n >Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital, an emerging markets-focused investment bank, argued that alongside Mr Xi’s crackdown, China’s per capita gross domestic product was now approaching levels where “the middle class begins to demand less corruption”. >\n >However, China is ranked as the country where businesses face the greatest corruption challenges by the Risk Advisory Group. Its 181-country index is based on the threat of corruption, the level to which foreign investors are exposed to enforcement action under the US Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the availability of reliable information to conduct integrity-based due diligence. >\n >“There is no denying that the country’s large market and growing middle class is attractive for foreign investors, but endemic corruption in some sectors, the close nexus between business and politics, and the high incidence of FCPA enforcement actions make for a high-risk business environment,” said Brendan McGloin, head of business intelligence, Asia for the group. >\n >Iraq, Nigeria and Angola are ranked as the next most challenging countries by the Risk Advisory Group, with Venezuela, Indonesia and Vietnam also in the top ten.  >\n >Elsewhere, Mr Robertson highlighted improvements in a number of frontier markets, such as Argentina, Tunisia, Vietnam, Romania and Pakistan.  >\n >He also praised Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari and John Magufuli, his Tanzanian counterpart, for their focus on fighting corruption, which in both cases has yielded a two-point improvement in the TI’s index, to 28 and 32 respectively.  >\n >Mr Robertson argued that reducing corruption tended to lead to higher equity prices, “because it increases the confidence investors have in the legal system which can be needed to support minority investor rights”. >\n >Some of the year-to-year movements in the index can be little more than “noise”, Mr Heinrich said. Larger, multi-year moves typically tend to be more significant. >\n >He cited Hungary, which has fallen seven points to 48 since 2012, and Turkey, down eight points to 41, as shown in the third chart, as examples. >\n >José Ugaz, chair of TI, warned that “systemic corruption and social inequality” was feeding “popular disenchantment with political establishments . . . providing fertile ground” for the rise of so-called populist parties. >\n >However, Mr Ugaz argued that populism was “the wrong medicine”, with the rise of autocratic leaders in Hungary and Turkey prime examples of that. >\n >“People are fed up by too many politicians’ empty assurances to tackle corruption and many are turning towards populist politicians who promise to change the system and break the cycle of corruption and privilege. Yet this is likely to only exacerbate the issue,” he said. >\n >“In countries with populist or autocratic leaders, we often see democracies in decline and a disturbing pattern of attempts to crack down on civil society, limit press freedom and weaken the independence of the judiciary. Instead of tackling crony capitalism, those leaders usually install even worse forms of corrupt systems.” >\n >Mr Ugaz cited Argentina, up four points to 36 in this year’s index, as an example of a country that has ousted a populist leader, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and is now starting to improve. >\n >TI’s overall rankings are headed by New Zealand and Denmark, with the highest-placed countries that some might consider to be emerging being Singapore in seventh out of 176 countries, Hong Kong in 15th and Uruguay in 21st. >\n >The Risk Advisory Group’s rankings are headed by Finland

He dismissed the idea that Rwanda tourism was worth the spending, with the suggestion the country was “making inroads to poverty” more as result of the aid it gets than the money it makes (by the way, that’s $50m a year from gorilla viewing permits, even before the adverts kick off).  >\n >Ms Akamanzi was amazed. She said Rwanda has cut its dependency on aid hugely (down to 17 per cent of the budget); that per capita income had tripled in 15 years; and that policymakers thought hard about “good choices” to “strive for self-reliance”. It is a country capable of making good decisions, she said, adding that Mr Humphry’s questions suggested he was ill-intentioned, ill-informed or biased.  >\n >If the Swedish statistician Hans Rosling were still with us, I suspect he would have called it something else. In his last book,  >Factfulness >, he outlined 10 human instincts that stop us understanding the truth. The relevant one here is the “destiny instinct”, the idea that things “are as they are for ineluctable, inescapable reasons: they have always been this way and will never change”.  >\n >Western views about  >Africa  >are a classic manifestation of this. We tend to think of it as one big disaster area, destined to be poor and corrupt forever. Of course it is not. Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Egypt now have life expectancies matching Sweden’s in 1970.  >\n >As Rosling said, “if you look for poor people in Africa you will find them”, but sub-Saharan African isn’t doing badly either. Since countries gained their independence 60-odd years ago (not long, is it?), they’ve  >expanded > their infrastructure “at the same steady speed” as European countries did when going through their own economic miracles.  >\n >At the same time, each has reduced its child mortality rate faster than Sweden did, Rosling said. In Rwanda that has meant  >bringing it down > from 114.6 deaths per 1,000 live births before the age of five in 2005, to 38.5 in 2016. That number is still horribly high but if you think of child mortality data as measuring the “quality” of a society (and you should), its speed of travel also represents astonishing progress.  >\n >Let’s not forget that there was extreme poverty in much of Europe 90-odd years ago and pretty intense poverty in many places only 40 years ago. (I have memories of primary school in Galway I can hardly make myself believe now.) Just 50 years ago China, India and South Korea, our latest miracles, were in most ways all far behind where sub-Saharan Africa is today.  >\n >The key point is that the destiny instinct makes it hard for us to grasp the extent of the change around us. Would you have guessed that Rwanda has a literacy rate of nearly 80 per cent (89 per cent of girls attend primary school) and that Kigali is one of the cleanest cities in the world, for example? When we see it where we don’t expect it, we think of it as temporary — in much of Africa’s case as “an improbable stroke of good fortune”. Do a web search for “Rwanda, economic mirage” and you will see this in action.  >\n >All this matters. That’s partly because it can make for dismal radio interviews but, for investors, it means you may not put your money where it will get the best long-term returns.  >\n >It could lead you to put too much money into developed markets. The destiny instinct works in all sorts of ways: look at how many years it took institutions such as the IMF to accept that the developed world is more likely to grow at 2 per cent a year than 3 per cent a year now — that “normal” can change. It definitely makes everyone put too little into what the industry calls “frontier markets” — even the name screams destiny instinct — but which are, more often than not, fast-growing, middle-income countries such as Vietnam.  >\n >That’s despite the fact that  >frontier markets > are where long-term global growth is likely to come from and that these markets are generally cheaper, faster growing, more tech-forward, and crucially much less correlated to other asset classes than most others (they are less integrated into the global economy, so care less when things change elsewhere). You should have a small part of your assets invested here for the very long term. I have favourites. I have written about why you should be in Vietnam, for example. So did Rosling: he told journalists, including me, that the greatest long-term investment was beach-front property in Somalia.  >\n >Sadly there isn’t a simple way into that at the moment. But if you do want to be in frontier markets there are plenty of entry points. You should do so via a fund, since one frontier market is risky, but 20 together probably isn’t.  >\n >Look at the  >BlackRock > Frontiers Investment Trust. It is a bit too focused on Argentina for me (and its managers seem irritatingly keen to be more in emerging markets than frontier) but has interesting investments elsewhere: 7 per cent in Nigeria, 4 per cent in Bangladesh.  >\n >Then there is Aberdeen Frontier Markets. Its short-term performance has been feeble but it is invested in Vietnam, Nigeria, Kenya and Pakistan.  >\n >Also consider the Templeton Frontier Markets Fund and the Ashmore Emerging Market Frontier Equity Fund. Both are overly keen on financial stocks but they offer reasonable country diversification and should be fine to buy and forget (for the very long term). Take the former over the latter for now. If you want to go passive (and in markets like these I probably wouldn’t) there is the iShares MSCI Frontier 100 ETF.  >\n >If you don’t feel brave enough to put money into any of this lot? Well, as Akamanzi said to Mr Humphrys: “I think you’re the one who has the problem.”  >\n > >\n >Merryn Somerset Webb is editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek.

For people seeking eye surgery, the city’s main draw is the Instituto Zaldivar — the initial letter is something of a logo, featuring on the doctor’s white coat and the doors of the elegant premises. >\n >“About 95 per cent of the people we see are from outside Mendoza,” says Dr Zaldívar, who specialises in refractive (procedures that correct common vision problems such as near- and farsightedness) and cataract surgery. Today, he says, he has carried out 33 operations. About 4,000 patients attend the institute each month. >\n >It has grown out of what started as a family business. His father, Roger, was from Mendoza and started the clinic having trained in the US. The younger Dr Zaldívar trained in the 1980s, including a stint in the US, and returned to Mendoza to work at his father’s side. >\n >It was an era of innovation. “Refractive surgery was just coming in,” says Dr Zaldívar. “I had the luck of being in at the beginning and having contacts with most of the people who were developing this technology.” >\n >Lots of the patients he had first met in the US were happy to travel to see him in Argentina. Since then the Instituto Zaldivar has opened two branches in Buenos Aires — a rare case of the Argentina capital being subsidiary to a far-flung provincial city. >\n >Patients cited by the institute include President Macri, along with perhaps the country’s most famous citizen, the footballer Diego Maradona. A photo of Brad Pitt adorns one wall: when the actor was filming  >Seven Years in Tibet > nearby, says Dr Zaldívar, many of the crew took the chance to seek treatment. >\n >The institute became so popular with outsiders that Dr Zaldívar has opened a similar clinic that exclusively serves patients from Mendoza itself — giving them more chance to benefit from procedures that were otherwise being booked up. >\n >“It was so difficult for people living here to get appointments,” he says. >\n >It runs a charity, the Fundación Zaldivar — created in 1990 and offering care exclusively to people with insufficient funds for private health insurance. The foundation treats 15,000 people annually, going on “tours” to treat patients in different regions of Argentina. >\n >His aim, he says, has always been to innovate and he was the first person in Latin America to introduce excimer lasers for surgery to correct myopia. He helped to pioneer the use of phakic intraocular lenses (IOL) — a type that can be inserted into an eye without removing an original damaged or defective lens. >\n >The first IOL was implanted in 1949 by Sir Harold Ridley, a UK surgeon who noticed how perspex fragments that had been lodged in the eyeball of a wounded pilot did not cause any infection or reaction. Sir Harold’s efforts, once resisted by the British medical establishment, led to a new field of eye surgery, the techniques of which went on to be developed by specialists around the world. >\n >Dr Zaldívar used methods refined in Russia by Svyatoslav Fyodorov, an eye surgeon, who ran for president against Boris Yeltsin in 1996 before dying in an aircraft accident four years later. >\n >“There are many things in which we have been pioneers,” adds Dr Zaldívar, who has a design laboratory in part of the institute. “We have helped to develop more than 100 different instruments.” He adds: “I hesitated between studying architecture and medicine at one stage. I love designing things.” >\n >Dr Zaldívar has always sought to innovate in terms of information technology. He ruefully recalls trying to exchange a few clinical notes electronically in the early days of email — “each page took seven hours to send,” he says. “We were too far ahead of ourselves.” Now, banks of screens in the institute and a video conference suite show how much diagnosis can be done remotely. >\n >The Instituto Zaldivar remains quite a family affair. Dr Zaldívar’s son Roger, an ophthalmologist in keeping with family tradition, is chief executive. Mendoza remains, Dr Zaldívar senior notes, the right base for such an establishment, with universities that produce a stream of good staff. >\n >“It is perhaps unusual not to be in the capital,” he says. But for him the biggest advantage that Mendoza has over the hurly-burly of Buenos Aires, he adds, is quite simply that “I can live in a town of a size I like, without traffic and where I can be at work in 10 minutes.” >\n >","title":"Argentina: Mendoza eye surgeon’s services prove top attraction","standfirst":"Family business thrives in ‘town without traffic’ and is renowned for

The currency has shed nearly a third of its value against the dollar over the past year, dropping over 10 per cent in the past four months alone. >\n >It hit a record low of 20.91 per greenback early Friday despite heavy intervention by the central bank this week. >\n >The currency, which had been down as much as 1.7 per cent this morning, cut back its losses to just 0.4 per cent to 20.63 after the interest rate move. >\n >Concerns have been mounting over the stubbornly high level of inflation in Argentina, which finished last year at almost 25 per cent, well above the bank’s target of 12-17 per cent. The issue is also proving to be President Mauricio Macri’s greatest economic challenge, with most analysts predicting inflation will remain above 20 per cent this year as the impact of utility tariff hikes continues to fuel prices. >\n >Analysts at Capital Economics said the peso’s bounce on Friday is unlikely to last, given the country’s growing economic woes.  >\n >“The emergency rate hike hasn’t come completely out of the blue,” they said. “A 2% drop in the peso against the dollar over the past 48 hours appears to have forced the bank to take more immediate action. The peso has come under severe pressure since the start of the year. And the central bank has been forced to intervene aggressively in the FX market in order to stem the decline, particularly in recent days.” >\n >Gabriel Gersztein, head of LatAm strategy at BNP Paribas, argued in a note earlier this week that an interest rate move would be actually be counterproductive by worsening the country’s fiscal accounts while doing little to tame inflation. >\n >“We stick to our view that Argentina is in a trap: due to fiscal dominance, we see only two ways outs: (a) an unilateral announcement of further fiscal adjustment and/or (b) sizeable [peso] depreciation,” he said. >\n >Alberto Ramos, an economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note on Friday: “The hike jives with the central bank’s increasingly hawkish rhetoric and the risk (perhaps already reality) of sizeable short-term capital outflows and steady loss of central bank reserves. In essence, the emergency rate hike seems to respond more to financial market risk management consideration rather than growth-inflation considerations.” >\n >Although Mr Macri’s administration has struggled to rein in inflation, it has made better progress in controlling the fiscal deficit. A primary fiscal deficit of 0.3 per cent of gross domestic product in the first quarter not only beating the official target of 0.6 per cent, but also improving on last year at 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2017. >\n\n\n\n\n\n >","title":"Argentina hikes interest rates to 30.25% as peso slides","standfirst":"Muscular move is aimed at propping up its currency amid inflation

But the government and prime minister Theresa May, who has Article 50 on her mind, have not. >\n >However, that was before an  >Argentine tycoon > from the shores of the River Plate began to stalk Aim-quoted Falkland Islands Holdings or FIH.  >\n >Two weeks ago Dolphin Fund, the investment vehicle of Eduardo Elsztain, Argentina’s biggest real estate developer, said it might bid for FIH.  >\n >On one level, it is hard to see what the fuss is about. For all that FIH was formed 150 years ago, it is a tiny business, making about £3m of pre-tax profits a year, on about £40m in sales, and is not going anywhere much. In the six months to September, pre-tax profits fell 28 per cent to £1m.  >\n >FIH makes some money from ferrying passengers across Portsmouth Harbour, some from shipping museum pieces across the UK. Profitability of both businesses is under pressure. >\n >More importantly, though, more than half of FIH’s revenues are tied to the Falkland Islands.  >\n >FIH is one of the islands largest employers and landowners, running the local supermarket and Land Rover dealership, supplying oil rigs and oil workers when they are in town and servicing the squid fishing fleet. >\n >And while the population of the south Atlantic archipelago is no bigger than that of a small English village, few have forgotten the Anglo-Argentine war over the Falklands in 1982.  >\n >Last month Staunton, the family investment vehicle of Edmund Rowland, executive chairman since 2013, and property developer and Tory donor David Rowland, offered £37m for the business. That translated as 300p a share for the 75 per cent of stock the Rowlands do not own. The board recommended the offer and FIH investors have until April 5 to accept.  >\n >The Staunton bid did set some shareholders muttering. FIH has £37m in net assets without including the group’s £4m or so in net cash, they say. Many are still smarting over the board’s “housekeeping” over Christmas 2015 when very small shareholdings were bought out by the company. These shares — about 2.6 per cent of FIH — were eventually bought by the Rowland family.  >\n >But these rumblings would have passed unremarked. Then Mr Elsztain broadcast his interest, raising the prospect of Argentine ownership of key Falkland Island resources.  >\n >Last week, FIH managing director John Foster and ex-army officer Jeremy Brade, the two independent directors not connected to the Rowland bid, dubbed Dolphin’s attentions as “unwelcome”, and “a real hazard to FIH”, arguing it “seriously threatens to undermine the . . . business and the interests of its employees”.  >\n >They pointed out that the Falkland Islands government withholds and grant licences for land and assets in the archipelago. It would hit FIH hard if it was stripped of these permissions. Unsaid is the fear that if islanders boycott FIH, revenues would immediately suffer. >\n >On Thursday, Dolphin — which owns 2.5 per cent of FIH — fired off another shot, accusing the independent directors of “scaremongering”. It had no intention of disrupting the status quo, it said, and reiterated its intention to bid at a “significant premium” to 300p. Dolphin has a little under four weeks to make an offer or shut up. >\n >Picking apart how FIH would fit into Mr Elsztain’s interests, which spread from South America to Israel, or why he — or indeed Staunton — wants FIH is tough. >\n >Dolphin’s approach may simply be a ploy to force Staunton to raise its offer.

Just as our brothers were one in battle, today it is our turn to unite,” said Maria Fernanda Araujo, the president of the commission representing the families of the dead, referring to the deep-rooted mistrust that had at first hindered the operation. >\n >Most agree that the event could not have happened without the UK and  >Argentina > putting aside past differences in the wake of Mr Macri’s election. >\n >It was Cristina Fernández de Kirchner who requested the help of the Red Cross in 2012 after the issue was brought to her attention in a private meeting with rock star Roger Waters.

It’s a very good example of what can be achieved when it is possible to isolate specific humanitarian tasks from all other aspects,” said Diego Rojas Coronel, who runs the Red Cross in Argentina.  >\n >It was the first time two states have come to an agreement of this kind with the Red Cross, which has carried out extensive forensic work in recent years in the Balkans and the Middle East, he added. >\n >“My boys are at last resting in peace,” said Geoffrey Cardozo, a colonel in the British army who was responsible for burying the Argentine dead after the war and was crucial to the operation to identify the corpses. “They are no longer orphans because they are in the hearts of their parents and brothers and sisters. It is a great relief.” >\n >“We’ve waited far too long for this moment,” said John Fowler, an editor at the local newspaper, Penguin News, as the Lament was played on the bagpipes. “I defy anyone not to feel pity for these families.

Mr Newman earlier this year approached the hedge fund about voiding the clause but was turned down, according to people familiar with the matter, which has forced him to wait until next year.  >\n >Mr Newman declined to comment on what he might do once the non-compete clause expires, but said that he “categorically denies” talking to investors about investing in or advising on investments in Venezuelan debt. >\n >Venezuela represents an enticing opportunity to hedge fund managers steeped in the intricacies of sovereign debt restructurings. Caracas last year admitted it could no longer service its $150bn pile of foreign debts, and since then has  >haphazardly defaulted > on a host of bonds, loans and other financial obligations. >\n >Other players in the sovereign debt industry expect that rather than return to front-line investing Mr Newman is most likely to be hired as some kind of adviser to one or several Venezuelan creditors, given his unique expertise in pursuing governments through the courts. At least one Venezuelan bondholder group has already approached the former hedge fund manager, according to people familiar with the matter. >\n >In a recent interview with  >Bloomberg TV >, Mr Newman said that Venezuela “has been impoverished by klepto-socialists” and warned that investors faced a “tortuous, long, complicated road”, something that some industry experts saw as an oblique, unofficial pitch of his know-how on navigating such a complex situation. >\n >The US government has slapped a series of sanctions on individuals in the regime, such as president Nicolás Maduro, and on the country’s debt — in practice making any resolution to the country’s default extremely complicated and leaving Venezuela’s bonds in  >legal limbo >.  >\n >Venezuelan bondholders, some of which are coalescing into a creditor group advised by Mark Walker of Millstein, have therefore refrained from legal action over the defaults, given how hard it is to seize government assets.  >\n >But ConocoPhillips’s  >$2bn legal award > against PDVSA, Venezuela’s oil company, has stirred up the situation. PDVSA owns some of the few overseas assets that creditors could conceivably seize, so Conoco’s award could force at least some bondholders to join the legal fray, according to Robert Kahn, a professor at the American University and a former Treasury and International Monetary Fund official.  >\n >“Bondholders were holding fire, partly because they thought it would be a long, protracted process.

I have ordered an investigation because it joined the coup-mongering call against the country, and that is not its function,” he said, adding “every two hours the company Movistar sent millions of messages to its phone and internet customers” as part of a “cyber war”. >\n >Telefónica was unavailable for comment, but it is not the only company caught up in the strife in Venezuela. On Wednesday,  >General Motors  >said it ceased operations after one of its plants was seized by local authorities. The US-based company said the move will cause “irreparable damage to the company and its 2,678 workers”. >\n >Tensions continue to grow as Mr Maduro’s foes demand early elections to speed up his removal from office amid worsening shortages of basic goods, violent unrest and political repression. Opponents are vowing no let-up in the pressure as the socialist leader clings to power. >\n >“When one lives in a lawless country, one has to take to the street to protest for our dignity and rights,” said Julio Borges, a leading opposition lawmaker.  >\n >Local media reported unrest in poor areas of the capital on Thursday night. Critics had called for protests across the country on Friday, a silent march in Caracas on Saturday of people dressed in white to commemorate those killed in the unrest, and a nationwide sit-in to block some of Venezuela’s main roads on Monday.  >\n >“Unrest has yet to reach a level that would prompt stakeholders to abandon President Nicolás Maduro,” wrote risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “Still, a more unified opposition, high social discontent, mounting international pressure, and fissures within  >chavismo > suggest that Venezuelan politics are entering a more fluid phase.” >\n >The opposition and the ruling socialists are trading barbs over the recent spike in violence. The former say a dictatorial regime is using armed “paramilitary” hoodlums to quash dissent, while the latter say protesters are “fascist” thugs who, with the connivance of Washington, want to violently overthrow the government. >\n >“This wounded and failed opposition is trying to generate chaos in key areas of the city and convince the world that we’re in some sort of civil war, the same playbook used for Syria, for Libya and for Iraq,” Freddy Bernal, a leading socialist party official, said in an unusual internet broadcast past midnight on Thursday. >\n >The protests are the largest Venezuela has witnessed since 2014 and were sparked by an attempted takeover of the opposition-controlled legislature by Venezuela’s  >Supreme Court >, which is stacked with government loyalists. They were further fuelled by officials barring presidential hopeful Henrique Capriles from holding public office. >\n >On Thursday, Mr Maduro said he would file a complaint against Mr Capriles, who accused the president of being responsible for two of the three deaths during Wednesday’s “  >mother of all marches >”, which drew hundreds of thousands of protesters and was met with harsh repression. “If he has to go to jail, he must go and pay,” Mr Maduro said.  >\n >“The dictator said he will sue me before ‘his justice’,” Mr Capriles charged, “that is easy, [let him] go first before the International Criminal Court in The Hague.”  >\n >Mainly supported by Russia, Bolivia, and Cuba, Mr Maduro is growing increasingly isolated. On Thursday, several Latin American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, “vigorously condemned the violence unchained in Venezuela” and asked his government to “retake the path of democratic institutionalism”.  >\n >“Without an electoral exit, and with extreme repression, radicalisation will gain terrain and the economy will deteriorate dramatically,” said the Caracas-based pollster and political analyst Luis Vicente León. “As I see it, and I wish I’m wrong, this will be a very long . . . and very dangerous fight.”  >\n > >Additional reporting by Tobias Buck in Madrid

core earnings of £27m for 2016, on sales of £382m. >\n >Its operations in Argentina and Colombia represent new markets for Inchcape, which already operates in Chile and Peru as distributor for BMW.  >\n >In addition, the acquisition shifts Inchcape’s focus from the premium car market in South America into mass market passenger cars and commercial vehicles. >\n >Inchcape already works with Subaru

But one of the missing resources is also one of the most important: public support. >\n >As a result of well-organised opposition to mining, expressed through a 2007 law in the area that dramatically limits what extraction can take place,  >Mendoza’s industry has languished >. A region widely supposed to have some of the same geological endowments as neighbouring Chile, a leader in global mining, has only a few quarries. >\n >The wider world has taken the hint. The Fraser Institute, the Canadian think-tank that publishes an annual ranking of mining jurisdictions based on their geology and policies, puts Mendoza 89th of 91 locations worldwide, better only than Kenya and Guatemala. >\n >“The most complicated part in Mendoza is the social aspect,” says Emilio Guiñazú, the sub-secretary for mining in the provincial government’s energy ministry. He accuses previous governments of having “run away from conflict” and allowed matters to escalate into irrational debate. >\n >“Trying to advance with mining when people do not understand what mining is and have an erroneous idea about it will be doomed to failure,” he says. “There is a totally distorted vision of the industry.” >\n >The province’s opposition to mining is mainly a result of fear over potential damage to the environment, particularly how over-use, pollution or accidents could endanger the limited water supplies. A related fear is that the government will prove ineffective in regulating the industry. >\n >Such worries led to the anti-mining law, 7722, which bans the use of some chemicals in mineral extraction. In effect, that kills a lot of mining projects. “It is like allowing people to drive but not allowing them to buy fuel,” says Raúl Rodríguez, head of the local mining chamber. >\n >Attempts to get round the ban, by trucking untreated ore out of the province to places where rules allow it to be processed, have not prospered. The law also allows Mendoza’s legislature the final say over the environmental impact studies of mining projects — a hurdle that, in the eyes of the industry, turns what should be a technical issue into a political one. >\n >Challenges to law 7722 in the constitutional court have failed, to the delight of anti-mining campaigners, and there is at present no intention to try to change the law. The government and the industry recognise this would be futile without a concerted effort to change public opinion. Mr Rodríguez says: “We have to answer the question: why is it important that Mendoza has mining? “We need to show what we are missing out on. That is the challenge.” >\n >Some of the answers lie just across the Andes in Chile, where mining is a mainstay of the economy. Mr Rodríguez says Chile’s share of the same part of the Andes as Mendoza produces $10bn a year in exports. Supporters of mining in Mendoza say there is no reason why its part should not be as successful given the similarity in geology and minerals. >\n >Mendoza’s mining chamber believes its resources could be worth $350bn, 10 times the value of the province’s oil resources. Almost all of this is copper, as in Chile. The chamber says this could be opened up with $16bn of investment and that, after five years, half a dozen mines could be generating $200m a year in taxes for the region. >\n >Mendoza’s need for mining revenues may become more apparent as royalties from the oil industry diminish. Mr Guiñazú says even with law 7722 in place some projects could advance. However, he acknowledges that the arguments over mining have harmed the confidence of investors, who have prioritised projects in more congenial areas. Mendoza’s resources, which include gold and iron ore, have slipped down the queue. >\n >Arguably the biggest lost opportunity is the  >stalled development of a potash mine > at Rio Colorado in the south of the province. >\n >Vale, the Brazilian owner and one of the largest mining groups in the world, once had high hopes of this project, which would have been a source of fertiliser for Brazilian farmers. >\n >But costs escalated and the economics of the potash industry changed as Mendoza prevaricated. Vale this year sold most of its potash assets — albeit not Rio Colorado — to the Canadian company Mosaic, casting doubt over how the scheme fits within its portfolio. >\n >Vale says that it carries on fulfilling its commitments and obligations to the project and is maintaining its mining rights: “The company continues, together with the Argentine authorities, to concentrate efforts to find the best alternatives for the future of the project.” >\n >A hope is that a scaled-down scheme can be more viable. The development of a trans-Argentina railway to supply the fracking industry, south of Mendoza in Neuquén province, provides an opportunity: with a relatively small extra investment a rail spur could be built to Rio Colorado, significantly cutting the cost of transporting mined potash. >\n >“It was going to cost $70 per tonne to get it to port at Bahía Blanca,” says Mr Guiñazú. “Now we think that

Jack Ma, the former English teacher who founded the group, works the stage like a seasoned diplomat. At the G20 meeting of global leaders in Hangzhou last year, Mr Ma hosted Australia’s Malcolm Turnbull, Canada’s Justin Trudeau and Italy’s then premier Matteo Renzi. >\n >In January he became the first Chinese businessman to sit down publicly with  >Donald Trump > after the US election — a full month before the US president  >spoke to Chinese president Xi Jinping >. Since then he has met the leaders of Argentina, Australia, Israel, Malaysia and Pakistan. >\n >Mr Ma’s ambitions for  >Alibaba >, the ecommerce company worth $309bn that began life in his Hangzhou apartment, are equally global. Come 2036, he wants sales across its platform to be bigger than the gross domestic product of the world’s fifth-biggest economy, outranked only by the US, China, Japan and the EU. It is aiming for 2bn customers, which on current numbers would be one in every four people on the planet. >\n >To achieve these goals, he has proposed ideas that sound more like the projects of a politician than a business leader. In order to strengthen the company’s crucial technology backbone, he pledged in March that “we will build Alibaba’s own ‘Nasa’”, a reference to the US space agency that masterminded the moon landings.  >\n >With global trade talks stalling, he has also  >unveiled a trading platform > he hopes will serve as a sort of World Trade Organization for small and medium sized businesses. “I think for the next 10 to 20 years, globalisation should be driven by business people,” he said last month. He calls the project “e-WTO”.  >\n >For all its dizzying international plans, however, Alibaba has so far struggled to gain  >a major foothold in the US >— something the group hopes to reverse with a plan to generate 1m jobs in the US on its ecommerce platform — or in Europe. It faces intense competition at home and the persistent speculation of a political backlash from Beijing.  >\n >Plenty of other Chinese companies have stumbled as they tried to expand overseas. Yet few observers are willing to bet against the group. “If globalisation got pregnant and had twin boys, they would be named Jeff Bezos [the Amazon founder] and Jack Ma,” says Michael Zakkour at Tompkins, a supply chain consultancy. “They are the perfect manifestation of  >globalisation 2.0 >.” >\n >*** >\n >In China, Alibaba’s tentacles reach into almost every aspect of life: shopping, finance, chatting, healthcare, entertainment and news. You can go for weeks in China without cash, swiping your phone to pay for coffee, clothing or utility bills. So ubiquitous is  >Alipay >, its online payment platform, that even some rough sleepers accept it.  >\n >A couple of cousins in search of easy money in Hangzhou netted only about Rmb2,000 ($300) from robbing three stores, proof that Alipay and rival WeixinPay have disrupted the business of burglary. >\n >Alibaba is responsible for one-tenth of China’s retail sales and has the  >biggest money market fund > (Yu’e Bao has Rmb1.14trn under management). It is the company that chased  >eBay >\n out of China and bested  >Yahoo >, acquiring its operations there in 2005. >\n >—————— >\n > >Alibaba’s treasures: >1. Core commerce and logistics >\n >\n > >Alibaba.com, the original platform, along with Taobao, AliExpress, 1688.com, TMall.com and Tmall Global provides portals for business-to-business sales and for brands to sell to consumers, as Amazon does in the west. It also replicates the function of Ebay. Juhuasuan offers flash sales on various products. Cainiao is the logistics arm of Alibaba >\n >\n >—————— >\n >Joe Tsai, executive vice-chairman, describes the group as “a big incubator of ideas”. Those futuristic visions include facial recognition payment and one stop consultation-to-pharmacy online healthcare services. Alibaba’s M&amp;A team is constantly on the prowl for investments: as well as myriad start-ups it has stakes in Snap and Lyft. >\n >Not all its operations make money. Its cloud business may be among the biggest new ventures, but it loses 8 cents on every dollar. Cainiao, the logistics platform that underpins the asset-lite ecommerce operation and delivers 57m packages a day, bleeds cash. Alibaba Pictures is  >warning of losses > of $140m. >\n >That does not faze Alibaba, which uses its ecommerce operation to finance new and fledgling businesses and build its own ecosystem.  >\n >The formula seems to be working: for the past  >fiscal year > to the end of March, it increased revenues 56 per cent to $23bn and generated net income of $6bn, making it considerably more profitable than  >Amazon >. \n >\n >—————— >\n > >2. Digital media and entertainment >\n >\n > >The digital media division includes the YouTube-like video site Youku Tudou, Alibaba Music, a streaming service, and Tmall TV (OTT), a smart TV and streaming business. Alibaba Pictures Group is a film and television company. It also includes Ali Sports, which promotes and markets sports and esports across China >\n >\n >—————— >\n >Outside China, Alibaba’s biggest reach is in Southeast Asia. It has a controlling stake in Lazada, the Singapore-based ecommerce group and, together with affiliate Ant Financial, a stake in India’s PayTM which enables payments with the swipe of a phone. >\n >Beyond the region, however, Alibaba’s footprint is so far more limited and the company has been on the acquisition trail to bolster its global coverage. >\n >“Right now I’m a little bit sceptical,” says one consultant who works in the sector. “Alibaba has failed to go after Europe. A lot of other Chinese players have struggled as they’ve expanded, in the US in particular.” Alibaba’s own early American adventure fell flat. Its 11 Main boutique ecommerce operation was sold in mid-2015 after a year. At least two of its investments, in messaging app Tango and “deep-linking” search engine Quixey, have stumbled.  >\n >—————— >\n > >3. Local services >\n >\n > >The division includes Koubei, a local commerce platform, and Ele.me, an online food delivery platform. Alibaba’s online travel portal was renamed Fliggy last year, and is targeting the increasing number of Chinese who want to travel overseas >\n >\n >—————— >\n >Alibaba shrugs off the mis-steps. Its aim in many of these projects, it says, is to learn as much as it can, and in any case it scores plenty of financial wins too. Jet.com, the ecommerce marketplace which it partly owned and was  >bought by Walmart > for $3.3bn last year, is a case in point. >\n >The group has used the growing numbers of Chinese tourists overseas to ramp up growth in Alipay’s international business. About 110,000 stores accept Alipay. It is also finding new partners. A partnership inked earlier this month with First Data makes Alipay an option for the commercial technology provider’s 4.5m US business users. >\n >Richard Windsor of independent research house Radio Free Mobile says Alipay is Alibaba’s Trojan horse into the US market. If fully implemented, the First Data deal would give it 4m US outlets at one swoop — putting it on a par with ApplePay. Souheil Badran, president of Alipay North America, says: “Our goal is to extend reliable payment services to the over four million Chinese consumers that visit North America every year.” >\n >But Mr Windsor cautions that greater availability may not translate into greater usage as Alipay’s QR code payment system “leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to easy and fun user experience” compared with alternatives in the US.  >\n >“An experience that is mediocre by developed market standards is a huge improvement on the offline experience in China, which is why I think QR codes have worked in China but failed in developed markets,” he wrote in a note to clients. >\n > >\n >—————— >\n > >4. Payment and financial services >\n >\n > >Ant Financial originated from Alipay, which combines an online payments system and a digital wallet. It includes wealth management, private banking, credit scoring and financial cloud computing services  >\n >\n >—————— >\n >Controversies have also dogged it overseas. There is a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission into its  >metric for gross merchandise volume >, and late last year  >Washington placed Taobao on its “notorious markets” > blacklist for peddling fake goods. >\n >While recently Alibaba has taken strides towards clearing its sites of fake goods — something of a Sisyphean task — Mr Ma’s earlier  >quip > that fakes were often of “better quality and better price than the real names” still rankles with brands and regulators. >\n >*** >\n >Perhaps Mr Ma’s biggest global gambit is the new global trading platform that Alibaba is developing. First unveiled last year, the  >electronic world trade platform > touches all the classic Alibaba buttons: small business, inclusivity — and the initiative seized from government by Mr Ma. >\n >The Doha Round, the long period of trade negotiations under the WTO that started in 2001, is “such a long round, I feel sorry for these WTO guys”, Mr Ma said last month in Malaysia, the first overseas member of the platform. The eWTP will essentially provide the plumbing for cross-border trade: logistics, managing customs clearance and securing favourable tariffs. >\n >—————— >\n > >5. Cloud computing, advertising and data management >\n >\n > >Alibaba Cloud is China’s largest provider of public cloud computing, offering cloud infrastructure services similar to those offered by Amazon and Microsoft. Alimama.com is an advertising and data management platform. The huge volume of consumer data from other parts of the business enables Alibaba to help merchants better target their ads >\n >\n >—————— >\n >Alibaba kicked off its grand plan for global trade without frontiers with a bilateral deal designed to ease the passage of goods shipped by smaller businesses between China and Malaysia. The pact, established as a public-private partnership in Malaysia’s digital free trade zone, will focus on infrastructure, including a fulfilment centre and co-operation on electronic payments and financing. So far, it is strictly logistics: favourable tariffs are still under discussion. >\n >It is understood to be in talks aimed at making Russia the next hub — one of the biggest markets for international ecommerce site AliExpress — in a move that would be even more challenging. >\n >There are plenty of obstacles ahead for Mr Ma’s plan, such as the backlash against trade liberalisation. But if the project gains momentum, he will be able to demonstrate that business — and not government — is flying the flag for globalisation. >\n >In its bid to increase its US presence, Alibaba has adopted a plan that it hopes will appeal to Mr Trump’s US, promising to create 1m US jobs by getting cherry farmers, dressmakers and possibly even candlestick makers to sell into China over Alibaba’s ecommerce platforms. >\n >Step one takes place next month at an inaugural conference to showcase the initiative in Detroit — a former industrial city whose decline has been attributed by some to globalisation.  >\n >To the critics that dismiss the 1m jobs pledge as pie in the sky, Alibaba points to China, where in the past 15 years it claims to have created 33m jobs: 10m merchants on its Taobao site create “a minimum” three jobs apiece, including in supporting services such as logistics. >\n >Still, Duncan Clark, a Beijing-based consultant who wrote a book on Alibaba, notes: “There have been all types of these platforms to bring niche businesses online.” Alibaba will have to win out over the likes of arts and crafts site Etsy, and bigger players such as eBay and Amazon. >\n >Others believe it has a fighting chance. “Three years ago [Americans] didn’t know who Alibaba was, that’s why going public was so important,” says another analyst. “I’ll bet you many American farmers watch CNBC. They’re businessmen at the end of the day.” >\n >Perhaps the biggest challenge facing Alibaba, ironically, is copycats at home. Its peers — Baidu and  >Tencent >, who together with Alibaba comprise China’s BAT tech trinity of internet giants — are jostling beside it in virtually every sphere. Tencent has a 37 pent cent share of the  >$5.5tn payments market >, to AliPay’s 51 per cent. All have amassed stakes in ride-hailing apps, food delivery, bike sharing and media apps, when the cost for internet companies of buying content such as video streaming is rocketing.  >\n >The desire to be present in every area is “like playing a game of Chinese chequers, not missing a trick”, says Mr Clark. >\n >Facing all these challenges, Alibaba says it is relying on fear to keep it ahead. It is run by a man with neither government connections nor engineering credentials.

But trade growth has stalled and, according to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), this is not only because of the bursting of the commodities bubble. High tariffs and other barriers both in China and in Latin America show that free-trade rhetoric has yet to be matched by action. >\n >In a recent report, “Uncovering the Barriers of the China-Latin America and Caribbean Trade”, the IDB details tariffs and other “discriminatory” policies afflicting the relationship. Their presence has contributed to a decline in trade between the two, which slowed to $247bn in 2016, a 7 per cent drop from the previous year and the third consecutive annual fall (see chart). >\n >According to the IDB, Latin America’s farmers have been hit particularly hard. Beijing imposes tariffs of 17.3 per cent on agricultural produce from Argentina, 17 per cent on that from Brazil and 16.1 per cent from Mexico, compared with its average tariffs of 13.4 per cent for the farm sector worldwide. The difference matters: soya alone represents a fifth of the region’s total exports to China. >\n >Manufacturing tariffs for Argentina and Mexico are also above the Chinese average. In this case, it works both ways: Chinese manufacturers face high tariffs in Latin America, particularly those imposed under Mercosur, the regional trade bloc that includes Brazil and Argentina. A blanket conversion to much lower tariffs set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development would benefit all, the IDB argues. >\n >Others agree on the need for a new trade agenda between China and Latin America, which should go beyond commodities to include higher-value products. >\n >“During the [commodity] boom years, Latin American countries were very passive, they just sort of expected Chinese demand to continue endlessly and didn’t do much to diversify exports, with [only a few] exceptions,” says Carlos Casanova, Hong Kong-based economist at BBVA. “You keep on hearing ‘la fiesta se acabo’ [the party is over]. I think Latin America is coming to grips with the fact that the Chinese economy is rebalancing and that they need to diversify the export basket.”  >\n >But the China-Latin America relationship isn’t just about trade. In its report, the IDB warns governments in Latin America not to be influenced by hopes of financial assistance from China as they negotiate trade deals. >\n >Chinese policy loans to Latin America have been conspicuous (see chart) and have sought to generate financial returns as much as political influence. Yet despite the region’s recent economic troubles, Beijing has remained committed to its closest partners, notes Margaret Myers, director of the Latin America and the World programme at the Inter-American Dialogue, a think-tank. >\n >Although the Dialogue found that finance by the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank to Latin American governments and state-owned enterprises shrank by nearly 14 per cent in 2016 from the previous year, Ms Myers notes that “if anything, it is an indication of China’s continued interest in Latin America. I’d have expected this [figure] to decrease considerably more considering the level of risk of the region.” >\n >But such interest does not seem to have heralded any modernisation of trade arrangements between the two sides. Latin America’s efforts to revise trade policies have been patchy, with Chile perhaps the noteworthy example, while attempts to discuss China’s trade barriers seem only to have caused offence. The issue is so sensitive that, according to one person with knowledge of the situation, China complained about the tone of the IDB report, which was first presented at a Financial Times/The Banker conference in Shanghai last year. Since then, the document has been withdrawn from the IDB’s website and is currently being “revised”, according to the bank’s press office. >\n >Exporters on both sides must hope that, should the document reappear, it will contribute to approximation on tariffs and other issues rather than any further upsets. >\n > >Silvia Pavoni is economics editor at The Banker, an FT publication. >\n

The US currency has risen 2.7 per cent since the start of April against its developed market peers, while JPMorgan’s EM currency gauge is down by 4.2 per cent against the greenback. A stronger dollar raises costs for emerging market companies servicing dollar-denominated debt.  >\n >On Thursday, Argentina’s central bank  >increased > its interest rates by 3 percentage points for a second time in less than a week, in a bid to halt the peso’s fall against the US dollar. It is down 9.4 per cent since the start of April, almost all of the decline coming in the past week. >\n >The Brazilian real has weakened 6.3 per cent since the start of April to just 3.52 per dollar, while the Mexican peso is down 4.6 per cent over the same period.  >\n >Rising US interest rates pose another headwind for markets in the developing world. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has climbed 55 basis points this year to 2.95 per cent, having briefly moved above 3 per cent at the end of April. Higher US rates reduce the value of dollar-denominated emerging market bonds, making them less attractive assets for investors to hold. >\n >“In 2017 everything was going right for emerging markets . . . [but] people got scared when the 10-year Treasury yield crossed 3 per cent,” said Federico Kaune, head of emerging market debt at UBS Asset Management. “If yields come back down you’ll see people come back to EM.” >\n >Global emerging market stock funds have fared better, despite the rising dollar reducing the value of investments made in local currencies. The fund group posted $333m of inflows but the trend since the beginning of 2018 has still been one of decline, with appetite well down from the $5.3bn of inflows seen at its peak for the year in January. >\n >The FTSE Emerging index of developing market stocks has now tumbled over 11 per cent from its January high, in part due to the devaluation of its constituent companies in dollar terms. The decline has erased all the index’s gains for the year. >\n >The EPFR data show that investors pulled $129m from funds focused on Latin American equities in the past week, a second straight week of outflows. Nonetheless, some investors remain bullish on the region, citing robust economic growth. >\n >“There is a major election coming up in Brazil, there is volatility in Argentina and we have Mexican elections,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors. “That is all going to be creating volatility but it doesn’t change the fundamental picture at the moment.” >\n > >Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock in New York. >\n >\n >","title":"Bond investors pull money from emerging markets","standfirst":"First two-week period of outflows since 2016 as US dollar rise spooks markets","byline":"By Joe Rennison and Robin Wigglesworth in New York","firstPublishedDate":"2018-05-03T23:19:23.000Z","publishedDate":"2018-05-03T23:19:23.000Z","webUrl":"https://www.ft.com/content/699a91bc-4f1a-11e8-9471-a083af05aea7","requestUrl":"https://api.ft.com/enrichedcontent/699a91bc-4f1a-11e8-9471-a083af05aea7","brands":["http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"],"standout":{"editorsChoice":false,"exclusive":false,"scoop":false},"canBeSyndicated":"yes","apiUrl":"https://api.ft.com/enrichedcontent/699a91bc-4f1a-11e8-9471-a083af05aea7","prefLabel":"Bond investors pull money from emerging markets","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article"],"annotations":[{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/3de2fad0-44c8-492f-9b62-7e1374292a9e","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/organisations/3de2fad0-44c8-492f-9b62-7e1374292a9e","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation","http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/Company","http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/PublicCompany"],"leiCode":"8I5DZWZKVSZI1NUHU748","FIGI":"BBG000DMBXR2","prefLabel":"JPMorgan Chase & Co","type":"ORGANISATION","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/company/PublicCompany"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/7b9542ed-b868-4ee5-9006-f0c2b74a010a","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/organisations/7b9542ed-b868-4ee5-9006-f0c2b74a010a","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation"],"leiCode":"BFM8T61CT2L1QCEMIK50","prefLabel":"UBS AG","type":"ORGANISATION","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/fddce8b4-05c2-460f-b89e-b6c36f4f4dcb","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/organisations/fddce8b4-05c2-460f-b89e-b6c36f4f4dcb","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation"],"prefLabel":"Emerging Portfolio Fund Research Inc","type":"ORGANISATION","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/c0449157-e184-3648-8e9d-e82d049953ee","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/people/c0449157-e184-3648-8e9d-e82d049953ee","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/person/Person"],"prefLabel":"Federico L.

That, surely, is the message implicit in the twitchy bond market reaction to the unexpected acceleration in US average hourly earnings revealed this month. In the recent weak bond market environment investors had already been demanding increased compensation for taking on duration risk. The latest upheaval simply confirms that inflation has replaced deflation as the greatest perceived threat to US Treasuries. Something similar is taking place in Europe, where fewer sovereign IOUs now inflict negative yields on their holders. >\n >The equity market response to the prospect of higher borrowing costs was spectacularly unhappy. But given that 2017 was the first year in history where the  >S&amp;P 500 failed to decline > by more than 3 per cent at least once in 12 months and that January provided a rip-roaring start to 2018, proof that stocks could not defy gravity indefinitely hardly came as a shock. A correction was overdue.  >\n >There are risks in attaching too much significance to a  >single month’s numbers >, but with unemployment at the very low level of 4.1 per cent and wage inflation finally rising, there must be a possibility that slack in the economy has largely been eliminated. It follows that output growth may now find a reflection in wage gains. That in turn could help propel increased demand.  >\n >One healthy aspect of the rise in bond yields and the still elevated level of equity valuations is that pension funds’ solvency ratios have had a welcome boost. Applying a higher discount rate to the liabilities while enjoying an uplift in the value of the assets is the answer in today’s low interest world to the pension fund manager’s prayer. This will also take some pressure off sponsoring companies at a time when many will be weighing the case for increased investment in fixed assets.  >\n >In the UK, funding currently enjoys an additional boost because of a steady stream of pension scheme members taking advantage of a recent rule change that allows them to transfer out. This improves pension fund hedge ratios — the proportion of liabilities that is fully matched — which is good news for those who stay put. So, too, with a recent reduction in longevity assumptions. >\n > >\n >\n\n\n >A further hint of a return to normality is the  >reappearance of volatility > after a long period in which it has been conspicuously absent — helpful if you worry that low volatility encourages complacency and makes the financial system more vulnerable to crises.  >\n >There are nonetheless caveats about where we go from here. Part of the unease in the bond market relates to the impact of Donald Trump’s fiscal largesse towards the corporate sector. The  >Tax Cuts and Jobs Act > is clearly good for corporate earnings, but it also increases the government’s budget deficit and already high debt.  >\n > >In a speech last month > William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, worried that the nation’s longer term fiscal burden was being increased when the government faced higher debt service costs and entitlement spending as the baby boom generation retires. He called the current fiscal path unsustainable and thought that the adverse dynamics of the tax legislation would counteract any favourable direct effects the package might have on capital spending and potential output. This is a damning verdict, coming as it does from one of the most respected figures in central banking.  >\n >At the same time there are grounds for concern about a credit cycle in which  >risk is clearly being mispriced >. This is partly a product of the enduring search for yield. When almost every asset class looks expensive, investors tend to respond by taking on more risk. This is most obviously true of emerging market debt, where a serial defaulter such as  >Argentina can issue 100-year paper > and find that the issue is oversubscribed.  >\n >In the developed world, the anomalies are less extreme. Yet it is striking, for example, that at the start of this week 10-year Italian government paper yielded just over 2 per cent, while the comparable US Treasuries yielded more than 2.7 per cent — a seemingly bizarre verdict on the two countries’ respective growth and public sector debt positions. And in the corporate high yield market yield compression has reached the point where investors are being offered seriously inadequate compensation for default risk. In banking, meantime, loan covenants are eroding much as they did before the 2007 credit crunch.  >\n >So while the global economy looks solid and pension funds are better placed, valuations in most asset markets still appear overstretched and there are disturbing pointers to financial instability ahead. A defensive stance at this late stage in the cycle should have merit. The snag for investors is that with cash offering a minimal return, going defensive feels expensive.  >\n >","title":"A strong global economy is no comfort to stretched markets","standfirst":"Economic growth is robust, but credit and equity markets are full of warning signs","byline":"John Plender","firstPublishedDate":"2018-02-06T12:02:09.000Z","publishedDate":"2018-02-06T12:02:09.000Z","webUrl":"https://www.ft.com/content/a04e7272-0b14-11e8-839d-41ca06376bf2","requestUrl":"http://api.ft.com/enrichedcontent/a04e7272-0b14-11e8-839d-41ca06376bf2","brands":["http://api.ft.com/things/dbb0bdae-1f0c-11e4-b0cb-b2227cce2b54"],"standout":{"editorsChoice":false,"exclusive":false,"scoop":false},"canBeSyndicated":"yes","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/enrichedcontent/a04e7272-0b14-11e8-839d-41ca06376bf2","prefLabel":"A strong global economy is no comfort to stretched markets","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article"],"annotations":[{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/6fe46b95-9b89-4765-ae25-b2ab71a4b90a","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/organisations/6fe46b95-9b89-4765-ae25-b2ab71a4b90a","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation"],"leiCode":"254900Y8NKGV541U8Q32","prefLabel":"Federal Reserve Bank of New York","type":"ORGANISATION","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/organisation/Organisation"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/isClassifiedBy","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/f021ef0a-e3a5-3530-9394-21a1eaf9f3f6","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/brands/f021ef0a-e3a5-3530-9394-21a1eaf9f3f6","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/Classification","http://www.ft.com/ontology/product/Brand"],"prefLabel":"Markets Insight","type":"BRAND","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/product/Brand"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/majorMentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/7d930a0a-dcc3-4d19-86ef-b13af31cbcf1","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/things/7d930a0a-dcc3-4d19-86ef-b13af31cbcf1","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/Topic"],"prefLabel":"Global economic growth","type":"TOPIC","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/Topic"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/isClassifiedBy","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/37b1e62e-93ff-4991-aa83-c1ec974d4802","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/things/37b1e62e-93ff-4991-aa83-c1ec974d4802","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/Topic"],"prefLabel":"Capital markets","type":"TOPIC","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/Topic"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/isClassifiedBy","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/b224ad07-c818-3ad6-94af-a4d351dbb619","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/things/b224ad07-c818-3ad6-94af-a4d351dbb619","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/Classification","http://www.ft.com/ontology/Subject"],"prefLabel":"Economic Indicators","type":"SUBJECT","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/Subject"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/isClassifiedBy","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/9268d10e-8e24-3dd7-b873-14c2789f382b","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/things/9268d10e-8e24-3dd7-b873-14c2789f382b","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/Classification","http://www.ft.com/ontology/Subject"],"prefLabel":"Corporate Finance","type":"SUBJECT","directType":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/Subject"},{"predicate":"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions","id":"http://api.ft.com/things/050a64b9-98da-354a-8f68-00191cb34906","apiUrl":"http://api.ft.com/people/050a64b9-98da-354a-8f68-00191cb34906","types":["http://www.ft.com/ontology/core/Thing","http://www.ft.com/ontology/concept/Concept","http://www.ft.com/ontology/person/Person"],"prefLabel":"William C.

Rather than updating the agreement to take account of the emergence of new industries since the deal was agreed in 1995, the Trump administration seems obsessed with fighting old battles, namely trying to repatriate more of the auto manufacturing supply chain to within US borders by fiddling about with so-called rules of origin. >\n >Even if the US achieves its aim, this is more likely to mean car manufacturers ignore the deal altogether and outsource more production outside the Nafta countries, paying tariffs rather than complying with more onerous regulations. >\n >The effect of President Trump on global trade remains uncertain, thanks to his eccentric policymaking, but it is unlikely to be positive.

rest of the world can only hope that calmer voices in the administration and Congress continue to prevail. >\n >","title":"Trump’s trade follies give Brussels an open door","standfirst":"The EU seeks

The US-based company has for decades relied on a far-reaching network of silos and ports to maintain its edge as a grain and oilseeds trader.  >\n >“The traditional business model in the ag supply chain is over,” Gert-Jan van den Akker, president of Cargill’s agricultural supply chain division, told the FT Commodities Global Summit on Tuesday. >\n >Mr van den Akker said Cargill and its rivals historically financed farmers and agreed to buy their crops during the growing season. At harvest they would purchase the crops, store them in company silos and trade around the inventory.  >\n >“You’d wait for markets to appreciate and then you would sell it. And that’s what created margins. That’s over. That doesn’t exist any more,” he added. >\n >His comments may help settle a debate on whether financial pressures facing the world’s big agricultural traders are a symptom of a temporarily slack grain market or reflect more structural changes.  >\n >Gary McGuigan, president of global trade at  >Archer Daniels Midland >, a Cargill competitor, said traditional ways of buying crops at one origin and dropping it off at a port were becoming outmoded. >\n >“I just don’t see how that sort of thing will survive,” Mr McGuigan told the conference.  >\n >In the past decade farms have grown bigger. Farmers from Ukraine to the US have invested in  >storage assets > in the form of mammoth plastic bags or corrugated metal silos, allowing them to decide when to sell supplies to merchants. >\n >Data on commodity prices, weather, crop yields and trade flows have also  >become affordable > for farmers and consumers, diminishing the value of grain traders’ inside knowledge. >\n >“There are no secrets today in the world of agriculture,” Mr van den Akker said in an interview. >\n >Big grain merchants continue to buy crops from farmers but have adapted to the changes. ADM, for example, has built up “destination marketing”, or bringing grain supplies closer to customers. Cargill has been offering more services to farmers, such as digital tools to guide cultivation. >\n >The executives spoke as volatility returns to grain markets because of  >a drought > in Argentina. Mr van den Akker said that, after initial expectations for a 57m-tonne Argentine soyabean crop, he now expected a crop of 40m-45m tonnes, or below 40m in the worst case. >\n >Soyabean prices have rallied back above $10 per bushel. “Things have bottomed,” Mr van den Akker said. >\n >","title":"Cargill executive calls time on traditional supply model","standfirst":"President of agricultural

Having attracted plenty of money, they have been going through one of their  >periodic downturns > marked by sharp price losses, negative headlines and even anxiety among some specialist EM investors. >\n >The cause and initial stages of these downturns tend to be broad in nature and quite blunt, amplifying concerns. But the longer-term implications vary from country to country, offering opportunities for those able to stomach the volatility. >\n >Although EM as an asset class has matured, the financial markets of emerging economies are still subject to exaggerated cycles. It’s not down to the lack of effort by many EM governments to learn lessons from previous crises. Instead, it highlights issues related to market depth and supply-demand imbalances, or what market participants call “technicals.” These lead to unsettling overshoots in the price of assets — both on the way up and down. >\n >The recent weakness in emerging markets — spanning bonds denominated in dollars, local debt as well as currencies — has been driven by changes in the global backdrop.  >Higher US interest rates this year > and a stronger dollar translate into tighter liquidity conditions for the asset class. For those EMs who import oil, the recent surge in crude prices increases import costs, aggravates the burden of energy subsidies and eats away at purchasing power. >\n >And the most vulnerable economies — those with large debts, high financing needs and uneven responses from policymakers — are hit hardest when global liquidity tide recedes. This is especially the case after an unusually long period of ample liquidity and low volatility has drawn lots of so-called cross-over investors who are not EM specialists. Their participation now extends well beyond traditional dollar-denominated bonds, and they have a considerable presence in local markets where they are taking both domestic interest rate and currency risk exposures. >\n >Given their relatively large size compared with EM specialists, the flows from such investors can turbocharge a rally. But they also are more likely to reverse at the first sign of major instability, whether it is externally or internally driven. And when the reversal occurs, as it has this year, even the stronger emerging economies find it hard to resist downward pressure on asset markets for two reasons. >\n >First, and as highlighted by the  >“Markets for Lemon” > hypothesis, which details how asymmetrical information can lead to worse outcomes, individual countries face enormous difficulties in asserting their distinguishing attributes when the broader environment is dominated by general noise. Their signalling is either lost or distorted. >\n >Second, when such cross-over investment managers do sour on the sector, sizeable off-benchmark bets constitute a big reputational risk for those investors who specialise in other asset classes. >\n >The sell-offs in securities issued by relatively strong emerging economies occur even though many tend to adjust policies in a timely fashion during a crisis. Yet what they face pales in comparison to those countries with weaker economic fundamentals and complicated historical relations with investors.  >\n >These pressures risk feeding on themselves and opening up further economic, financial and institutional vulnerabilities. It’s been highlighted by  >events in Argentina >, where President Mauricio Macri has been forced to turn to the IMF, and  >Turkey >, which has experienced a record and disorderly currency depreciation. >\n >There are three investment implications to take away. >\n >Investors should resist being shaken out of positions in countries with solid domestic economic conditions, strong balance sheets, limited indebtedness and management agility such as Colombia. If anything, a downturn in prices triggered by global events can provide attractive buying opportunities. >\n >The approach investors take to countries with middling economic and financial conditions, such as Brazil and South Africa, should be influenced by how quickly the authorities respond to the externally driven deterioration in their operating environment. Buy if they have the willingness and ability to react promptly. >\n >However, an even more careful approach is required for the weakest economies suffering the largest dislocations. But as long as their actual risk of actual default is low, any exaggerated moves in these countries’ markets present buying opportunities for those investors able to withstand significant volatility, starting with foreign currency debt, then local bonds and currency. >\n >The outsized role of cross-over investors versus EM specialists doesn’t receive the attention it deserves. Yet it improves both tactical and strategic positioning in the market, as well as enhancing understanding of the opportunities offered by different countries, securities and currencies. >\n > >Mohamed El-Erian is chief economic adviser to Allianz and author of the book ‘The Only Game in Town’ >\n >\n\n >","title":"Emerging markets turmoil can be navigated profitably","standfirst":"Influence of

Wheat production is expected to fall back 1 per cent to 736.6m tonnes, although with usage also dropping, inventories are forecast at another record high of 247.7m tonnes. >\n >While adverse weather is always a risk, other forecasters have noted volatility in the global currency markets as a potential cause for volatility for agricultural commodity prices during 2017. >\n >In its annual outlook, Rabobank said the  >euro was likely to depreciate > as a result of French, Dutch and German elections during 2017.

But, in fact, long-term growth and development has continued to vary enormously across emerging market (EM) economies.  >\n >Between 1992 and 2016, GDP per capita in China, South Korea and Poland caught up 20 to 25 percentage points relative to the US whereas South Africa, Russia and Saudi Arabia did not see any catch up on this metric. >\n >There was some ‘convergence’ — poorer countries grew somewhat faster than richer ones, on average. But the huge variation in growth between countries at roughly the same level of development shows that convergence is conditional. >\n >Among the structural factors that help explain such differences in growth performance, a sizeable manufacturing sector is central. Labour productivity tends to be higher in manufacturing than in agriculture and services. That provides a powerful engine of intra-sectoral productivity growth, in addition to that stemming from rural to urban re-allocation of labour between sectors. Other benefits include on-the-job training and economies of scale. >\n >Some service sector activities also confer benefits such as economies of scale. But that is true mainly for the kind of tech companies that dominate Silicon Valley, of which few originate in EMs. India grew substantially in the last two decades while relying on exports of services rather than manufactured goods. However, that was from a low base. When India grows fast it faces supply-side bottlenecks and its ambitious growth aspirations depend on a stronger manufacturing sector.  >\n >But the productivity-related benefits of manufacturing are particularly pronounced compared to raw commodity production and export. Moreover, most raw commodity exporters have suffered from ‘Dutch disease’ symptoms such as unhelpful real exchange rate appreciation. And many commodity-oriented EMs have also been afflicted by the ‘natural resource curse’, with governments and business focusing on rent-seeking rather than raising competitiveness and productivity. >\n >Not surprisingly, since the 18th century there are few examples of economies that got to high income status without a strong manufacturing sector. And we found that EMs with a relatively high share of manufacturing in GDP caught up significantly more with the US in 1992-2016 than others. While China, South Korea and Thailand benefited from a particularly large manufacturing sector, India, Brazil, Chile, Russia and Saudi Arabia were held back by a small one.  >\n >A sizeable manufacturing sector is necessary but not sufficient. Export orientation is also key. The imperative to sell manufactured products on foreign markets incentivises firms to be competitive while sales on international markets help reap economies of scale. >\n >Indeed, we found that, other things being equal, EMs that export a larger fraction of manufacturing production have seen faster catch up. Malaysia and the Czech Republic benefited from the export-orientation of their manufacturing sector while in Argentina, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Indonesia, trend growth has been held back by limited export orientation of the manufacturing sector. >\n >Even export-oriented manufacturing is no guarantee for sustained catch-up to high income levels if it is largely based on foreign direct investment attracted by low wages. For the key benefits of manufacturing — productivity growth, scope for innovation, movement up the value chain and economies of scale — to accrue in full, the technology must be mastered domestically, evidenced by substantial research and development (R&amp;D) and innovation.  >\n >To be sure, R&amp;D and innovation are not conditions for sustained growth at modest levels of development. But, they become conditions for further catch-up in middle income countries (MICs), so that they can avoid the middle-income trap (MIT). Indeed, the degree to which technology is mastered has been an important factor in explaining the variation in catch-up among MICs in 1992-2016. And the problem is that, while some MICs now devote sizeable shares of GDP to R&amp;D and engage in substantial innovation, others see remarkably little R&amp;D and innovation. >\n >China, Czech Republic, Russia, Singapore and South Korea rank high on our R&amp;D and innovation indicators, relative to their level of development, while Chile, Mexico, Romania, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates rank particularly low. The scores of Argentina and the Philippines are mediocre.  >\n >When we put together the scores of countries on these three dimensions, China and the Czech Republic appear relatively well-positioned for further sustained growth and to avoid the MIT (Singapore and South Korea are also well placed but are already high income economies). >\n >Malaysia and Thailand score well in terms of having a large, export-oriented manufacturing sector, while Mexico and Romania score OK on that metric. But all four of them score poorly on innovation and R&amp;D, suggesting that technology is not sufficiently mastered domestically, putting them at risk of falling in the MIT. >\n >Russia scores very well on innovation and R&amp;D. But it has an unimpressive manufacturing sector, in part resulting from Dutch Disease and Resource Curse issues. As a result, the research output is not sufficiently leveraged towards economic development.  >\n >Our growth forecasts for 2017-26 show some continued convergence — other things equal, we expect countries with higher GDP per capita to grow slower. However, reflecting the above findings, the countries that we expect to grow relatively strongly in the coming decade, given their income level, generally score relatively well on export-oriented manufacturing and mastering of technology. Having said that, in the case of India and Indonesia, our relatively constructive long-run growth forecast is conditional on further implementation of key economic reforms.  >\n >We expect Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, South Africa, Russia and Saudi Arabia to continue to grow relatively slowly, trendwise, in 2017-26, consistent with relatively weak scores on the three criteria discussed here.  >\n >Chile caught up relatively well in 1992-2016 — in large part due to good policies and institutions. Nonetheless, we forecast its trend growth in 2017-26 to be on the low side, given its current income level, reflecting a small manufacturing sector and unimpressive scores on R&amp;D and innovation. >\n >Our conclusions are sobering, as they suggest that several major EMs may struggle to avoid the MIT. But it is what it is. >\n > >Louis Kuijs is Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics >\n >\n\n\n >","title":"Manufacturing innovation key to EM break out growth","standfirst":"EM countries hoping to

He argued that everyone ought to work the land, and believed that the ills of a society built on serf labour should be cured through a return to subsistence agriculture. >\n >The Tolstoy clan fled Russia after the 1917 revolution: Daniil Tolstoy, like the vast majority of his great-grandfather’s many descendants, is a foreigner in all but name. He is a Swedish citizen, speaks with a distinct British accent and struggles with the Russian language. But now, the LSE-educated economist is following his famous ancestor’s call back to the land. He has started a farm in Russia. >\n >Through Across Invest, a Stockholm-based company with a Swedish family as its main investor, Tolstoy has founded  >Tolstoy Heritage >. This Russian-based company has bought 5,800 hectares of fields — about 20 times the size of a normal farm in EU countries, but an average size for a commercial agricultural enterprise in Russia.  >\n >With 123 million hectares in arable land — the world’s third-largest area behind only India and the US — Russia has the potential to be an agricultural superpower. The country has 36,400 agricultural enterprises and 174,600 farmers, according to the 2016 agricultural census.  >\n >And although the broader economy has been in the grip of recession over the past two years,   >agricultural output has grown > from Rbs4.3tn (£55bn) in 2014 to Rbs5.6tn last year — stimulated, in part, by Moscow’s embargo on western food imports, introduced three years ago in response to US and European sanctions. >\n >“We are a country that can and must feed itself,” prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said in 2014. In 2015, President Vladimir Putin went further still, claiming that Russia could become the world’s largest supplier of “healthy, ecologically clean, high-quality food”. In his annual policy address in December 2015, Putin called for a push to make the country completely self-sufficient in food by 2020. >\n >Tolstoy says his venture won’t be just any farm, but a farm with a mission. “We are going to build the first true organic farm in the country — I want to create the Duchy Originals of Russia,” he says, referring to the organic-produce brand established in the UK by the Prince of Wales 25 years ago. Eventually, Tolstoy plans to build a house close to a picturesque lake on a sloping spot ringed by forest. “Then we can spend the weekends here, or more,” he says.  >\n >Tolstoy Heritage is just one of the enterprises trying to ride the wave of Russia’s very own food revolution. In Soviet times, Russian culinary habits were formed by what was available: Salad Olivier, a popular dish based on the recipe of a Tsarist-era French chef, was made with carrots instead of the original caviar. Long after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow restaurant menus were dominated by poor imitations of sushi and spaghetti carbonara. However, that began to change in the late 2000s, when the economic boom fuelled by oil exports created an urban middle class that started to crave the same kind of fresh, healthy food it saw on offer elsewhere in Europe. >\n >“In 2011, people began to take a real interest in where their food comes from. Many of our urban residents were well travelled by then. They picked this up from Italy, the UK, Switzerland, where it was absolutely mainstream to be conscious about the origins of your food,” says Boris Akimov, founder of the farm co-operative  >LavkaLavka >. >\n >Akimov, a burly 39-year-old with a thick beard, is one of the pioneers of the farm-to-table movement in Russia. A decade ago, while writing restaurant reviews as a journalist on the Moscow-based magazine Afisha, he started cooking as a hobby. He then began taking an interest in historic Russian recipes, only to find that many of the ingredients were unavailable. “In Moscow supermarkets there was no turnip, no geese. When I started scouring markets all over Moscow, I eventually found a goose — but the vendor was unable to tell me where it came from, how old it was or how it had been raised,” he recalls. >\n >His reporter’s instinct tickled, Akimov started investigating the supply chain. “I ran into one wholesale trader after another, and often the products were imported or came from some big meat plant.” So, in 2009, he began travelling all over Russia to find farms that would sell him meat, vegetables, berries and butter directly. After sourcing what he needed, he and a friend started sharing their farm contacts with others to lower transport costs. “It began with one farm, then it was five, then 12. Now LavkaLavka has more than 200 farms,” he says. In 2010, Akimov finally quit his job in journalism to focus on running a business that now owns a shop, a farm-produce delivery service, two restaurants and a farmers’ market. >\n >LavkaLavka’s restaurant menu features delicacies such as Kamchatka crab with cream cheese and apple jam and barley porridge with duck giblet confit, tarragon, smoked pepper sauce and blackcurrant. The names of the farmers behind every ingredient are listed, and the company arranges farm visits for patrons who want the full experience. >\n >Akimov, who appears in company ads with a suckling pig on his arm, says Russian consumers have developed an appetite for farm produce — and not just for health and environmental reasons: “Just like city dwellers in the west, they like the sense of authenticity it gives you.” >\n >In 2014, this budding farm-to-table trend received a sudden boost from macro-economics and geopolitics. Europe and the US slapped sanctions on Russia, following its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. The Russian government responded with a measure often ridiculed as a punishment of its own people: in August that year, it banned the import of a wide range of agricultural goods and food products from countries backing the sanctions. Comprising the US, the EU and a smattering of their allies, these also happened to be Russia’s largest sources of food imports. >\n >While the embargo pushed up inflation to double-digit rates for more than a year, there was method behind the madness: the government is trying to use Russia’s political isolation and stand-off with the west to resurrect an industry that has been languishing ever since the collapse of the Soviet economy in 1991 sent it into a tailspin. >\n >Despite its vast swaths of arable land, Russia used to import more than 40 per cent of its food prior to the sanctions. In Venyov, the rural district where Tolstoy Heritage is located, only 30 per cent of all agricultural land is currently under cultivation, according to Jens Bruno, the chief executive of Across Invest.  >\n >With the imposition of sanctions, that had to change. To achieve this, the government launched an “import substitution” programme — subsidised loans and tax incentives for investment in agriculture and food processing, and even state grants for certain acquisitions of agricultural equipment. >\n >Thanks to what agricultural economists have called a perfect storm, the programme might just work. Following the crash of global oil prices, the rouble, which tracks commodity prices closely due to Russia’s high dependency on commodity exports, lost more than half of its value against the dollar between early 2013 and early 2016. In other words, Russian assets became dramatically cheaper, and anything produced in Russia with mostly rouble-denominated input became a lot more competitive. >\n >Big investors are having a field day with the cheaper rouble prices of agricultural assets. Since 2014, some of the country’s largest conglomerates have grabbed the opportunity to accumulate agricultural land banks and build or expand their agro-industrial operations. These include Cherkizovo, one of Russia’s largest meat producers; Rusagro, another big agricultural producer; companies owned by the family of Alexander Tkachev, the country’s agriculture minister; and Sistema, the group controlled by oligarch Vladimir Yevtushenkov. >\n >“Of course [the embargo] helps us,” says Pavel Grudinin, director of Sovkhoz imeni Lenina, a co-operative formed out of a former state farm on the outskirts of Moscow, which grows fruit for sale in the capital’s markets. “Most farms in Russia didn’t invest properly for ages because it was never worth it — you could always make more money in the oil sector, by speculating in property or just through some corrupt schemes. Now, there is a window of opportunity with some of the international competition locked out.” >\n >Andrei Sizov, managing director of SovEcon, an agriculture consultancy in Moscow, says that cheese production and vegetables are benefiting the most from Russia’s food-import embargo. >\n >But these opportunities remain out of reach for many of Russia’s small farmers. Sergei Denisov, whose family grows grain on a small farm in Novosibirsk region, says he would like to diversify into milk farming but has no chance of getting a loan for buying livestock and the necessary equipment.  >\n >“For the banks we have asked, the threshold remains very high,” Denisov explains. “It takes at least three years for a milk farm to start creating some serious cashflow, and therefore we would need to have several thousands of hectares of land as a security to get a loan. Since we don’t have that, we can only continue what we have been doing — sell our best grain for food purposes and the rest as chicken feed. When the weather is bad and the harvest doesn’t work out, I have to earn extra income as a taxi driver.” >\n >Akimov, too, reports that while government subsidies have helped farmers, many small farms fail to get access to the cheap loans that would be essential to boost investment. And most analysts agree. “The effect of the import-substitution policies on the Russian agricultural sector has been muted,” says Sizov. The government’s goal of making the country feed itself remains elusive: according to last year’s trade statistics, it imported US$25bn of agricultural and food products while exporting US$17bn. “I believe the negative balance will continue to decrease in the medium term only gradually,” says Sizov. >\n >In Moscow, however, the sudden ban on European food products has sent the capital’s foodies on the hunt for local produce. LavkaLavka launched a farmers’ market in a huge mall on the outskirts of Moscow in late 2015, and opened its second restaurant this spring. Moreover, the embargo and the political attention given to agriculture have attracted new small-scale farmers and artisanal food producers. “Hundreds of people who had long thought about leaving the city, moving back to nature, are now taking the plunge,” says Akimov.   >\n >No sector has been boosted as strongly as cheese. Eataly, the Italian delicacies retailer, opened its largest franchise outside Rome in Moscow in May without a single wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano. The opening, which had been imminent when the sanctions hit, was delayed for two years to build up alternative supply chains, not least for locally made cheeses. >\n >“It is a real boom,” says Alexander Krupetskov, a former computer programmer who opened Cheese Sommelier, Moscow’s first specialised cheese shop, in June 2014.  >\n >Krupetskov’s business grew out of a personal love for food that he was unable to find in Moscow. Returning from trips to France and Italy, he despaired when his requests for a cheese with a nutty flavour would produce blank stares from Moscow shopkeepers. “I thought there must be a niche catering to people like me,” he says.  >\n >He started his shop with French and Italian cheeses. “When the embargo hit, just a month after I opened, I thought this was the end.” >\n >But after a year of barely surviving by selling stock and offering cheese from Switzerland — the only European country with high-quality cheese to escape Moscow’s embargo — new Russian producers started appearing. “A lot of people who used to do other things began making cheese — lawyers, accountants, doctors,” says Krupetskov. “Many of them partner with foreigners,” he adds, unwrapping a fresh goat’s cheese that a French cheesemaker from the Moscow region had dropped off that morning for him to sample. >\n >Krupetskov says his customers have adjusted more quickly and completely than he would have liked. “The focus on Russian produce and the lack of European delicacies have become so dominant that people are forgetting the taste of European cheese,” he says, somewhat melancholically. “When we have a new local cheese on offer, they sometimes rave that this is better than French cheese. Of course, that is not true. It probably never will be.” >\n >But business is booming. Today, Cheese Sommelier sells up to 500kg of cheese a month, and has franchises in three other Russian cities. It works with 40 Russian suppliers and five Swiss ones. >\n >The shift mirrors changes seen across the Russian market. Prior to the sanctions, 52 per cent of the cheese consumed in the country was imported; last year domestic production accounted for more than 70 per cent. >\n >There is, however, a big gap between the demand reflected in this boom and Moscow’s ambitions for self-reliance in food, partly explained by the uneven implementation of the government’s import-substitution programme. >\n >“We would like to offer our products at a bit more affordable prices, but it’s impossible because we can’t get enough quality milk,” says Anastasia Osokina, a cheese vendor at a market in the Central Russian town of Rybinsk, who offers products from BeauReve Maslovka, an artisan maker of French-inspired Camembert-style cheeses from the Lipetsk region.  >\n >Any cheese at Osokina’s stall costs at least Rbs2,000 per kilo — on a par with imports from Switzerland, and more expensive than cheeses from new import sources such as Argentina or Tunisia. The same price range applies to LavkaLavka and Cheese Sommelier — high-end outlets where few can afford to shop. Meanwhile, the average supermarket shelf is filled with yellow cubes of industrial, rubber-like cheese that cost as little as Rbs300 a kilo, which barely covers the cost of the milk needed to produce it. >\n >The explanation for the divergence between these two extremes can be found in trade statistics. Although Russia’s domestic cheese production grew by at least 20 per cent in both 2015 and 2016, domestic milk production stagnated, while palm-oil imports soared. Officials at Russia’s consumer watchdog confirm that many industrial-cheese producers substitute palm oil for milk in their cheeses. >\n >For Tolstoy, such teething problems, together with the cheap rouble and the Russian government’s incentives for agricultural investments, have helped to make a business case for his farm. Last year, Tolstoy Heritage bought a bankrupt agricultural enterprise in Venyov, a town about 60km east of Yasnaya Polyana, for Rbs282m. The price included land, machines, buildings and storage — a bargain in an area that now has some of the highest prices for agricultural land in all of Russia. >\n >“This is the closest to Moscow where you can still get black-earth land,” says Bruno, a tall blond Swede who comes to the venture with experience from running Grain Alliance, a massive Stockholm-listed agricultural enterprise that has 51,000 hectares under cultivation in Ukraine, almost 10 times the scale of the new Tolstoy farm. >\n >Russia’s agriculture has traditionally been concentrated in a belt running across the south of the country as well as Ukraine — regions that are blessed with dark, fertile soil as fine as dust. The relative proximity of Tolstoy Heritage to Moscow will lower transport costs and allow the company to bypass middlemen and sell its produce to the capital’s comparatively affluent consumers directly. >\n >In May, seeding for rapeseed and summer wheat started for the first time. Over the next few months, the company plans to build up a milk and dairy operation that could require additional investment of up to €10m. “It is great timing with the embargo, and we have great opportunities,” Tolstoy says. “Agriculture having been down for so long, people here no longer know how to make anything. That’s our chance.”  >\n >He wants to buy Abondance cows, a French breed that gives only half the amount of milk of Holstein cows, the most productive breed, but is of higher quality with more proteins. Tolstoy is also itching to bring in Vincent Lefevre, a French cheese master who runs a chain of cheese shops in Stockholm, to help him build up cheese production. The two have plans for using and expanding a set of caves in a hillside on the farm’s land for ripening the cheese. >\n >However, the whole venture has become a lot more complex than Tolstoy ever imagined. When he was first looking into the idea of starting the farm, he enlisted Ilya Tolstoy, a great-nephew from a branch of the family that has long lived close to Yasnaya Polyana, to hunt for suitable land and research what government incentives were applicable. His conclusion: the venture wouldn’t be able to attract financing or become profitable unless they went for a much bigger scale. To manage the farm it now has, Tolstoy Heritage has installed a GPS-based monitoring system that shows the location of every tractor at all times. >\n >“It sometimes makes my head spin, how big this has all grown,” Tolstoy says. The field that he watches being ploughed during our visit has an area of 110 hectares — as big as 157 football fields. >\n >Bruno is now working to make Tolstoy’s dream fit into Russian reality. “Of course, you could do organic farming in Russia on a smaller scale but if you do it the European way, just 200 hectares or so, it’s too small, nobody will finance it,” he says. >\n >The massive scale-up in size means it may be impossible to run organic operations from the outset. The government is pushing to make Russia a supplier of clean food, and the first green shoots of formerly non-existent organic agriculture are starting to emerge. Although the country has yet to create a national certification system for organic food, 82 Russian producers were recognised as organic by a handful of foreign certification groups as of 2015, according to the  >Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FIBL) >, a Swiss-based group that collects data on the sector around the world.  >\n >The area of farmland converted to organic agriculture in Russia also doubled in 2014 and increased by another 57 per cent in 2015, making it one of the countries with the fastest-growing organic land reserves in the world, according to FIBL. >\n >When Tolstoy Heritage acquired its fields, they had been fallow for at least three years, creating, at one level, ideal conditions for organic farming. “Look at all this life in there,” says Bruno, picking up a lump of moist black earth crawling with worms.  >\n >He adds, however, that cultivating these fields without using any pesticides might require tractors to go over them five times as frequently to deal with weeds, wasting a lot of diesel fuel and delaying a first profitable harvest. “We may have to clean everything up once to make some money first that we can use to build up the organic portion,” he says. >\n >The new investors are also finding the locals a lot less welcoming than they had hoped. While preparing one of the fields for seeding, they discovered a pit at its centre that turned out to be a rubbish dump used by the nearest village. The company plans to clean it up this autumn, but villagers are now angry that their convenient dumping ground has been closed. >\n >Attempts to acquire an abandoned concrete building from the local government as a shed for its farming equipment failed: the mayor sold the shack to a third person who then offered to resell it to the foreigners at more than double the price. >\n >Running the farm is also proving more complicated than expected. While test-seeding some winter crops last year, the investors found local staff needed more oversight than they had arranged for. “The local workers were stealing fuel all the time,” says Tolstoy.  >\n >Moreover, management has to have constant discussions with tractor drivers over how accurately they should plough. “I get dissatisfied when I see these overgrown stripes next to the road,” says Bruno. But when he mentions that to Denis, the young Russian tractor driver, his answer is short and decisive: “But there is so much land in Russia!”  >\n > >Kathrin Hille is the FT’s Moscow bureau chief >\n

It’s a fate often suffered by the euro. This month, Free Lunch has noticed a few such cases and would like to offer a fairer interpretation. >\n >A new academic  >paper on fiscal austerity > after the global financial crisis is interpreted by  >Matt O’Brien > at the Washington Post as showing that “the euro really has been a doomsday device for turning recessions into depressions”. But here is what Christopher House, Christian Proebsting, and Linda Tesar, who wrote the (excellent) paper, actually say: “The negative relationship between austerity in government purchases and GDP . . . holds for countries with fixed exchange rates as well as those with flexible exchange rates.” In other words, not specific to the euro. Indeed the country with the best growth performance in their sample is Lithuania — which had dramatic austerity, a large fall in output, but the fastest recovery of the 29 countries (all European, plus the US). >\n >The main finding of the research is hugely important: it is that countries could have had significantly faster growth and greater incomes if they had imposed less austerity — to the point that their debt burdens would have been lighter. As we have  >insisted before >, it is easy to show arithmetically that cutting deficits too fast can make debt problems worse rather than better — and what House and colleagues demonstrate is that this seems to have been the case in practice. But that is the opposite of an indictment against the euro. It rather exonerates the single currency from blame for the disastrous growth experience of many eurozone countries — because that disaster was caused by unforced policy choices by leaders, to which alternatives existed. This study is aligned with  >previous studies > that show how much better eurozone economies could have fared with better policies that were at hand, but tragically left unused. >\n >My colleague Matthew Klein, too, is eager to blame the euro for the woes of its member countries, or at least for Greece. He observes that the Greek crisis experience is one of the worst in history — worse than the Great Depression in the US. He thinks that this observation implies that Greece  >should have left the euro > long ago. We have  >refuted > the common  >post hoc ergo propter hoc > fallacy about the single currency before — the notion that because eurozone economic performance is poor, the poor performance is due to the euro — but it is worth dwelling on Klein’s argument.  >\n >It is essentially comparative. The fact that the US could reflate after leaving the gold standard in the 1930s is thought to show Greece’s euro membership to be an obstacle to growth. In a  >follow-up post >, Klein compares the Greek depression to the post-financial crisis performance of five emerging markets that let their currencies float: Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand and Turkey. He correctly observes that those countries had milder busts and quicker recoveries (and indeed had stronger booms before their crises). What can we conclude from this about the role of euro membership in Greece’s crisis? >\n >Nothing really. There are plenty of other differences between Greece and Klein’s handpicked sample, in particular the much higher level of public debt. And you can easily pick another sample of crisis economies that didn’t float — such as Bulgaria and the Baltic countries (note the Lithuania finding in the paper mentioned above) — which  >also > performed much better than Greece. Klein himself refers us to a  >paper > by Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Thomas Philippon and Dimitri Vayanos, which establishes that Greece did much worse than a broad sample of fixed-exchange rate countries, including those in the eurozone. >\n >What went wrong, then? Klein’s attention to the US in the 1930s is useful, because it helps to pinpoint the things that policy got right then. Surely the banking reform as well as the big spending programmes under the New Deal had a lot to do with the recovery — as the eurozone’s excessive austerity and failure to restructure banks have to do with the weak recovery now. But what was the effect of changing the value of the dollar? Above all, the reduction in the real value of the debts accumulated in the 1920s. But debt writedowns are perfectly doable within the eurozone. Indeed they have been done — for sovereign debt in 2012 and senior banking debt in 2013 — although too little or too late.  >\n >The core mistake in eurozone economic policy was the unwillingness to restructure debts in 2010. Doing so then would have removed uncertainty, alleviated the push for austerity and loosened financial conditions by cleaning up bank balance sheets. If any country had left the euro, this restructuring would have been unavoidable. But it would have been the writedown, not the monetary divorce, that would have produced the result. And so it’s not monetary union, but the irrational sanctification of debt by all its leaders, that is at the root of Greece’s problem. >\n\n >Other readables >\n > >IMF researchers  >decompose the slowdown > in international trade into its various causes, and find that it mostly reflects sluggish demand growth around the world. >\n >The good, the bad and the bubbly: the Bank Underground blog finds that whether  >cross-border finance > does more good than bad depends on whether it takes the form of debt or equity, who is doing the financing and in which currency.

After monetary and fiscal policy mis-steps, the Argentine peso fell to a record low and the country’s debt tumbled in price. Its 100-year bond — issued almost a year ago and  >lapped up > by investors hailing a new market-friendly government —  >sank from > 94 cents on the dollar last month to a low of 83.1 cents. >\n >But a series of substantial interest rate increases and a promise to reduce the budget deficit more quickly have helped stabilise markets, with the “century bond” holding just below 87 cents on the dollar on Tuesday in London. Both Payden &amp; Rygel and T-Rowe Price — US investment groups that bought the century bond when it was sold — say they have taken advantage of the rout to buy more Argentine debt.  >\n >“You can’t get better in terms of a textbook macroeconomic response to this kind of pressure, and the markets have responded in kind,” said Alexis Roach, a senior analyst at Payden who covers Argentina. >\n >Argentina’s travails came at a time of a broader  >souring > on emerging markets, with JPMorgan’s EM currency index falling to a one-year low and EM stocks tumbling more than 11 per cent from their January highs. JPMorgan’s emerging bond index was down 4.4 per cent for 2018, its lowest level in over a year. >\n >Arjun Divecha, head of emerging market equities and chairman at GMO, said the developing market stumble was caused by a mix of idiosyncratic problems in countries like Argentina and the dollar’s recent renaissance.  >\n >But given the fundamental backdrop was different, Mr Divecha said he doubted that the EM wobble would deepen into something more worrying — such as a rerun of the 2013 “taper tantrum” triggered by talk from the Federal Reserve that it would scale back its bond-buying programme. >\n >“The big difference is the valuations of EM currencies, which are much lower now. Most emerging markets are now also running fairly sound fiscal and economic policies,” he said.  >\n >For  >Argentina >, investors said its troubles began with a policy error in December. The central bank revised its inflation target to 15 per cent, up from the previous goal of 8-12 per cent, raising inflation expectations in the market and sending the peso lower. >\n >As the central bank persevered with its policy, lowering interest rates by 1.5 percentage points in January, investors, led by hedge funds began to  >question its credibility >. Despite attempts to support the peso by spending $5bn of its foreign currency reserves and two sharp interest rate increases — from 27.25 per cent on April 27 to 30.25 per cent, and then to 33.25 per cent less than a week later — the currency kept sliding.  >\n >But on Friday, the  >central bank increased > the policy rate to 40 per cent, and the government pledged to cut its primary fiscal deficit to 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product this year, from a previous target of 3.2 per cent.  >\n >“What we were really looking for is what we saw [Friday],” said Richard Hall, an emerging markets analyst at T-Rowe Price. The move also reassured investors that authorities were poised to do more if needed. >\n >“Argentina needed a shock-and-awe policy adjustment because the market had gone into panic mode,” said Mr Hall. >\n >Still, Argentina’s problems are a reminder that the global economy is “volatile and full of surprises”, Mauricio Cárdenas, Colombia’s financial minister, told the Financial Times.  >\n >“The best antidote to these things is to have a well-balanced economy with low inflation, a low current account deficit and a low fiscal deficit,” he said. “But no one can say for certain that they’re totally protected, that they’re not vulnerable to financial market volatility.”  >\n >One country that continued to worry some investors is Turkey. The country’s woes have been somewhat overshadowed by the Argentine drama, but even as Buenos Aires appeared to steady its ship, Turkey was taking on water. The lira weakened a further 0.6 per cent to 4.29 per dollar on Tuesday. >\n >With a 22 per cent drop, the Turkish stock market had the worst performance of any bourse in the world outside of Venezuela.  >\n >Paul McNamara, a fund manager at Gam, argued that while Argentina had the ability to rectify its mistakes, Turkey looked as though it would slide into a deeper crisis. If the central bank does not raise rates aggressively to support the currency, the lira will tumble even further — an unpalatable option given the country’s heavy overseas borrowing, said Mr McNamara. But if it does tighten monetary policy drastically, it will inflict severe damage on the local banking sector and economy.  >\n >“There’s not much wrong with Argentina that higher rates cannot fix, but there’s not much Turkey can do that won’t make things worse,” he said. “A crisis looks inevitable.” >\n\n >","title":"Argentina’s ‘shock and awe’ appears to pay off","standfirst":"Investors have

They seem to be second globally now, behind Denmark, and are in the vanguard of emerging economies that are catching up,” he added. >\n >Despite this, FT analysis of IEEFA data suggests that, as of 2016, wind and solar power only accounted for 3.4 per cent of electricity generation, on average, in the 48 emerging countries for which it has data. >\n >The figures vary from 30 per cent in Lithuania, 26 per cent in Uruguay and 13.7 per cent in Romania, to zero in several Gulf and Balkan states, as well as Russia and Indonesia. >\n >Wind and solar accounted for 10.9 per cent of power generation in developed countries in the same year, with Denmark leading the way at 46.7 per cent, ahead of Portugal, Spain and Ireland, all above the 20 per cent mark. >\n >When all renewables, including hydropower, geothermal energy and biomass are factored in, the emerging market countries covered by the IEEFA on average generated 23.2 per cent of their electricity from such sources in 2016. >\n >Most of the leaders are mountainous countries in South America and the Balkans that are well placed for hydropower, such as Brazil, which generated 80.5 per cent of its power from renewables in 2016, Colombia (62.6 per cent), Ecuador (59.8 per cent), Croatia (67.3 per cent) and Montenegro (62.1 per cent), alongside Baltic states Lithuania (70 per cent) and Latvia (54 per cent), which are part of the EU’s subsidy regime. >\n >The laggards are largely fossil fuel-rich states such as Turkmenistan, Trinidad and Tobago and Algeria, alongside Gulf quartet Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE, in each of which renewables account for less than 1 per cent of generation. >\n >Emerging countries again lag well behind developed states on this measure, though, with the latter on average sourcing 45.1 per cent of the electrical power from renewables in 2016. >\n >Iceland is the global leader, with all of its electricity being generated by hydro and geothermal power, followed by Norway and New Zealand, also heavily reliant on water power. >\n >Although all forms of renewable energy are useful in combating climate change, some analysts such as Mr Wynn focus largely on wind and solar power, which all countries    are capable of producing even if they do have the geography or geology for large-scale hydro or geothermal plants. >\n >As such, he suggests Tamil Nadu and Uruguay provide strong examples that others could seek to emulate. >\n >Although Uruguay drew 26 per cent of its power from wind and solar in 2016, IEEFA’s data suggest this has continued to rise since and hit a record 43.6 per cent in January, as the first chart shows, although this figure is likely to fall somewhat later in the year given the inherent seasonality of these energy sources. >\n >“This almost certainly makes Uruguay number two worldwide, behind Denmark. Uruguay has seen a CAGR [compound annual growth rate] in wind and solar generation of 132 per cent from 2013 to 2017,” Mr Wynn said. >\n >He attributed the rapid growth to Uruguay’s highly regulated electricity system, which has provided investment clarity, allied to a political goal to reduce dependence on energy imports, such as oil for thermal generation and electricity imports from Brazil and Argentina. This push has been so successful that the country is now a net electricity exporter. >\n >The small nation of 3.4m people does have a couple of natural advantages that not all emerging economies can count on, however. Firstly, its abundant hydropower, which accounts for the bulk of its power generation, provides it with the base load when variable wind and solar power are not producing the goods.  >\n >Secondly, when these variable sources are working hard, Uruguay can simply export its excess electricity to its two giant neighbours, something that would be harder for a large country surrounded by smaller states to achieve. Denmark, the market leader, also benefits from this factor, thanks to its connections to Germany’s grid. >\n >As such, the lessons from India, a far poorer and larger country, may be more instructive.  >\n >“There are some really amazing things going on [in India] in terms of renewable power,” Mr Wynn said. >\n >In particular, he pointed to the southern state of Tamil Nadu, where wind and solar power accounted for 14.3 per cent of energy generation last year (and zero emissions sources in total 28.1 per cent, factoring in nuclear, hydro and biomass). >\n >Until overtaken by China in 2016, the state boasted the largest single-site solar project in the world (a 648MW capacity plant operated by  >Adani > Green Power). Tamil Nadu’s strength in nuclear power, accounting for a third of India’s output, helps guarantee it the stable base load that variable wind and solar power still cannot deliver. >\n >More broadly, Mr Wynn said: “India has made solar farms attractive for investors. It is effectively plug and play, with guaranteed grid connections and guaranteed uptake from operators.” >\n >The country has built a fully integrated national grid over the past decade and in 2016 adopted a 10-year plan which, if fully delivered, would quintuple production of variable power. >\n >With the price of solar technology tumbling, at recent reverse auctions companies bidding to provide solar power have offered prices “a staggering” 20-30 per cent lower than domestic coal-fired plants, Mr Wynn said, and “imported coal-fired power and liquefied natural gas power plants have overnight become stranded assets, requiring tariffs double that of new renewable energy”.  >\n >Moreover, 25-year feed-in tariffs have been agreed with zero inflation indexation “so they are essentially deflationary, which is great for a country like India which is trying to bring down inflation”. >\n >Heymi Bahar, renewable energy markets analyst at the International Energy Agency, was also optimistic about the pace of wind and solar power growth in India, as well as neighbouring China, but warned the picture was less bright elsewhere in Asia. >\n >Several south-east Asian nations offer generous feed-in tariffs to wind and solar producers, Mr Bahar said, but stringent caps limit the capacity these tariffs apply to, while weak grid connections and still cheap coal mean a faster rollout of renewables is unlikely.  >\n >In much of Eurasia, poor infrastructure and unattractive prices mean wind and solar output is very small, although Mr Bahar saw signs of change in energy-hungry Pakistan and Iran. >\n >Africa is perhaps the key area that is lagging behind, however. In many African countries, the central problem is lack of concessional financing to fund a range of infrastructure projects, with renewable energy only one sector that suffers as a result, according to Mr Bahar. >\n >For instance, the largest wind power plant in Africa, at 310MW enough to supply 1m homes, has been built at Lake Turkana in Kenya, he said, but it is currently sitting idle because the transmission lines to connect to the grid have not yet been built.  >\n >Moreover, even if energy companies are able to enter into long-term agreements with utility companies to supply renewable power, there can still be uncertainty as to whether the latter will ultimately be able to afford to pay the agreed tariffs throughout the life of the contract.  >\n >Despite this, Mr Bahar believed significant progress was possible because the demand for increased power across Africa is so great, and the continent’s latitude means solar, alongside wind, could be the cheapest way of meeting this demand. >\n >The two technologies accounted for just 1 per cent of Africa’s power generation in 2016, and under both the IEA’s current policies scenario and new policies scenario, the continent would continue to lag a little behind the rest of the world by 2040, although it is expected to overtake Latin America, as the second chart shows. >\n >However, under the IEA’s sustainable development scenario — the pathway considered necessary to stop global temperatures rising by 2C — wind and solar would need to account for 44 per cent of Africa’s production by 2040, the highest proportion of any region in the world.  >\n >","title":"Developing countries fail to shine in green energy","standfirst":"Rollout of renewables lags behind developed world despite rapid progress in Uruguay,

Maradona — who reveals in this book that he regularly scored with handballs — recalls his illegal strike with pride. “I beat out Shilton because physically I was in the best shape of my life.” >\n >He is an exuberant narrator, bursting with telling details. His earlier autobiography  >El Diego > covered similar ground, but for this enjoyable new effort, Maradona says he rewatched for the first time all Argentina’s matches in the World Cup he won almost single-handed. >\n >He had the leisure to do it. He lives in Dubai now, in a house with many TV sets. Having coached Argentina to disaster at the World Cup of 2010, he can’t get another serious job in football. Moreover, the romantic leftist considers himself a “political exile” from his homeland under rightwing president Mauricio Macri. No wonder he’s nostalgic: “Indulge me, and let me remember — if only for a little while — how much fun I had.” >\n >His first World Cup, in 1982, had ended with his sending off for kicking a Brazilian in the groin. Going into the ’86 tournament, he was 25 but still an unfulfilled talent. “I was the  >giocoliere >, the juggler . . . no victory laps or titles for me.” He was also already using cocaine. >\n >The World Cup provided the motivation he sometimes lacked. He fired himself up by telling himself endlessly nobody believed in Argentina: “You’re all against us? Really? You’ll see.” >\n >As captain he also took it upon himself to fire up his teammates. He called endless “team meetings” at which he made long bombastic speeches about how everyone hated them. It all sounds like a workers’ co-operative in Cuba. >\n >This was just before TV money flooded into football. The Argentine squad’s Mexico City training camp was, he says, “a whorehouse with no whores!” The place was still under construction, had just one phone line, and had only expected 16 players, whereas 22 showed up. Two players had to sleep “in a shed area, with a cardboard partition”. Some rooms lacked bathrooms, so the squad’s match day ritual was to shave outside, and then have pasta for breakfast, because most games kicked off in Mexico’s blazing noonday heat to suit European TV schedules. Still, it wasn’t all suffering: the book includes a lovely picture of Argentina’s players having lunch outside at a long table covered with enough soft drinks to start an obesity epidemic. >\n >Maradona’s personal team of unorthodox medics and layers-on of hands kept him fit, at least by his standards. Before each game, they swathed him in bandages to protect him from the kicking his opponents always inflicted. The players also got daily injections “to strengthen our livers”. Watching the games now, he boasts: “Not even my daughter Dalma could fit into those little shorts I wore.” >\n >The emotional highlight was the quarter final against England. Maradona, a Peronist nationalist, recalled that in the Falklands war of 1982, “seventeen-year-old boys had gone out to fight in Flecha tennis shoes, shooting pellets at the English, who decided how many Argentine boys they would kill”. For him, beating England would be revenge. >\n >And yet, he says, “It was a gentlemen’s match.” When some pushing and shoving broke out on the field, “we ended up shaking hands, almost apologizing”. Afterwards the English came into the Argentine changing-room to swap shirts. By then he had followed up his “hand of God” with a solo dribble that is now considered football’s most glorious goal. His teammate Jorge Valdano told him: “You’re not the best player in the World Cup; you’re the best player in the world.” >\n >Victory in the final against West Germany was his coronation. Afterwards he rode around on the back of one of the Argentine fans who had invaded the field. Then the team flew home with the trophy overnight, in economy class, doused in whisky, jumping and chanting abuse at the world. “Team management flew first class,” Maradona adds. >\n >It’s a shame that the translators mangle football vocabulary (“I scored the goal at a penalty kick at the end of the first period”), but Maradona’s authentic voice of unreason and the best story in World Cup history carry you through. >\n > > >Touched by God >: How We Won the Mexico ’86 World Cup >, by Diego Armando Maradona and Daniel Arcucci, translated by Jane Brodie and Wendy Gosselin,  >Constable,

A stronger US dollar and higher bond yields also sapped appetite for EM.  >\n >“Argentina wants to be pre-emptive and issue as soon as they can, even before Trump is in office, so they have a cushion to play with for the rest of the year. What they are trying to do is smart,” says Jorge Piedrahita, chief executive of Torino Capital, a broker-dealer in New York.  >\n >Luis Caputo, finance minister, said last week that Argentina’s financing needs total $22bn this year, with interest and amortisation payments adding another $21bn.  >\n >He did not specify how much Argentina needed to raise from the market, but said that the government was talking to several international banks about an imminent transaction whose size would depend on demand. >\n >Mr Piedrahita added: “If they can raise $10bn they will,” arguing that Argentina’s 2017 financing needs lie “easily north of $30bn”, including provinces and the private sector. >\n >With financing requirements that are greater than most of its peers, regional political pressures in Argentina could also undermine attempts later in the year to tap the markets, with important legislative elections in October that will determine the future of Mr Macri’s market-oriented reform programme. >\n >Patrick Esteruelas, head of research at EMSO Asset Management in New York, pointed out that there was likely to be a flurry of issuance from emerging markets in January, with Brazil, Honduras, Nigeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines all sounding out investors.  >\n >The risk of higher funding costs and a less benign market environment means that it makes “perfect sense” to front-load as much hard currency issuance as possible, Mr Esteruelas said. >\n >Although Argentina’s foreign debt burden remains relatively low, at about 33.5 per cent of gross domestic product, according to Credit Suisse, Mr Macri’s continued reliance on foreign creditors to finance a difficult transition away from a decade of  >populist economics > has weighed on market sentiment in recent weeks.  >\n >Argentina was one of the most heavily penalised emerging market credits after Mr Trump’s election victory, and concerns remain that investors may struggle to digest another year of bumper debt issuance from Argentina after $22bn of sovereign bonds last year, and $34bn in total, including provinces and the private sector.  >\n >Other investors are more optimistic, pointing to growing signs that Argentina’s economy is finally rebounding, after a 2 per cent contraction in 2016, as well as a historic tax amnesty that has already seen Argentines declare some $100bn held in offshore accounts. >\n >“Too many people drank the kool-aid way too quickly and without reservation,” says Mr Esteruelas, referring to the market euphoria over Argentina’s triumphant return to the capital markets earlier this year after its protracted absence following a catastrophic debt default in 2001.  >\n >“But just as the market was guilty of being excessively optimistic about Argentina last summer, now it has become excessively pessimistic,” he added. >\n >","title":"Argentina races to sell new dollar bonds","standfirst":"Country looks to pre-empt risk of higher funding costs and

Although the coffee regions have received rain recently, concerns exist about how long they will last. >\n >“Most areas will need to see some consistent rainfall now to keep the potential for a big crop alive as trees need to recover from stress from the production year last year and also the cold and dry winter,” said Jack Scoville at Price Futures Group in Chicago. >\n >Developing weather patterns can suddenly retreat, however. In 2016, a widely predicted La Nina pattern failed to materialise. Nevertheless, any production shortfall in grains and oilseeds caused by weather risks volatility in prices as demand remains strong and stocks are falling, according to analysts. >\n >In soyabeans, consumption is projected at an all-time high in the 2017-18 crop year, and inventories are forecast to fall 6 per cent from the prior year, according to the International Grains Council. For corn, global inventories are forecast to fall for the first time in five years, with the US and China accounting for most of the declines. >\n >","title":"Commodity traders and farmers on edge
