Week of 4/20 Notes:
Wrote script to read files x months before an event
: Based on 18 months leading up to May 2018, Argentina
 - > Amount of articles contain at least 1 of a country referrence not that useful
	- picks up a lot of compilation/overview/EM in general
 	- can eliminate a lot of these if you check how many other countries are referrenced
	- compilation/recommendation articles seems to use a lot of the same flags ">  >  >" appears in them - link/formatting?
 - > Possible additional flags used
	- President's name, currency name, capital city name
 - > Amount of articles containing 1-2 references does not seem responsive to crisis, sum of refferences accross articles yes

Next steps:
 - > Rerun with lemmatization, stemming
 - > Try tfidf and count vectorizer
 - > Finer time intervals (week, day v. month)
 - > Look at number of articles in time period with >x mentions
	- > Smallest x that yields pattern?
