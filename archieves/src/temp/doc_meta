BEIJING -- For most customers the Guoan Restaurant is nothing more
than a typical neighborhood eatery, with quick service, low prices and
tasty "family-style" cooking.

But the 10-table restaurant is also a model of another kind,
exemplifying the tough task China faces as it tries to extricate its
three-million-man People's Liberation Army from what is arguably the
world's biggest business empire. For like about 20,000 other businesses
in China, the Guoan Restaurant is for all purposes a PLA-run business,
despite its sale last year to a private entrepreneur.
